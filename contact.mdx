## What to Expect

### No Pressure, Just Conversation

This is a relaxed discovery call where we'll:

- **Listen to your challenges** - What's eating up your team's time?
- **Explore opportunities** - Where could automation make the biggest impact?
- **Share our approach** - How we work and what we can deliver
- **Discuss next steps** - Only if there's a clear fit for both sides

### Come As You Are

No need to prepare a pitch deck or have all the answers. Just bring:

- Your biggest pain points
- Questions about productization
- Curiosity about what's possible

This is about understanding if we're a good match. If we're not the right fit, we'll point you in the right direction - no hard feelings.

## Project Requirements

### Before Your Call

To make the most of our time together, consider:

1. **Identify Pain Points** - List your top 3-5 most time-consuming repetitive tasks
2. **Current Tools** - Note what tools and systems you're currently using
3. **Team Size** - Know your team structure and who handles what tasks
4. **Growth Goals** - Have a clear picture of where you want to be in 6-12 months

### What We Need From You

To move fast and deliver 10x value, be prepared to discuss:

- **Your core value proposition** in one sentence
- **What process you repeat** for every client
- **What prevents prospects** from understanding your value
- **What would make someone say** "I need this now"
- **Your timeline and budget** for transformation

<Info>
  We're intentionally selective to ensure we deliver exceptional results. If
  we're not the right fit, we'll tell you immediately and point you in the right
  direction.
