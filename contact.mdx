## Let's Build Your Productized Tools

We only work with agencies where we can deliver 10x value. If you're ready to transform your services into scalable products, let's explore how we can help.

## What to Expect

### No Pressure, Just Conversation

This is a relaxed discovery call where we'll:

- **Listen to your challenges** - What's eating up your team's time?
- **Explore opportunities** - Where could automation make the biggest impact?
- **Share our approach** - How we work and what we can deliver
- **Discuss next steps** - Only if there's a clear fit for both sides

### Come As You Are

No need to prepare a pitch deck or have all the answers. Just bring:

- Your biggest pain points
- Questions about productization
- Curiosity about what's possible

This is about understanding if we're a good match. If we're not the right fit, we'll point you in the right direction - no hard feelings.

## Project Requirements

### Before Your Call

To make the most of our time together, consider:

1. **Identify Pain Points** - List your top 3-5 most time-consuming repetitive tasks
2. **Current Tools** - Note what tools and systems you're currently using
3. **Team Size** - Know your team structure and who handles what tasks
4. **Growth Goals** - Have a clear picture of where you want to be in 6-12 months

### What We Need From You

To move fast and deliver 10x value, be prepared to discuss:

- **Your core value proposition** in one sentence
- **What process you repeat** for every client
- **What prevents prospects** from understanding your value
- **What would make someone say** "I need this now"
- **Your timeline and budget** for transformation

<Info>
  We're intentionally selective to ensure we deliver exceptional results. If we're not the right fit, we'll tell you immediately and point you in the right direction.
