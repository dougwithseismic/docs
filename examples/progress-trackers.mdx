  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should data refresh?">
    Critical metrics should update in real-time or hourly. Less critical data can update daily. Set clear expectations about update frequency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should we show when we're behind schedule?">
    Yes, transparency builds trust. Show delays with explanations and recovery plans. Clients appreciate honesty and proactive communication.
  </Accordion>
