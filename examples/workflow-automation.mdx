## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What tasks should we automate first?">
    Start with high-frequency, rule-based tasks that don't require creative judgment. Focus on tasks that consume significant time but add little strategic value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do we handle exceptions in automated workflows?">
    Build in exception handling with human escalation paths. Monitor exception rates and refine rules to handle common cases automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will automation replace team members?">
    Automation frees team members from repetitive tasks to focus on strategic, creative work. It typically leads to growth, not reduction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How complex should workflows be?">
    Start simple and add complexity gradually. Complex workflows are harder to maintain and debug. Break complex processes into smaller, modular workflows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Start Automating

## Getting Started with Workflow Automation
