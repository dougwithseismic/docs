## Common Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do we handle last-minute changes?">
    Build in flexibility buffers and have clear escalation processes for resource conflicts. Use the tool's scenario planning to quickly assess impact.
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="What about part-time and freelance resources?">
  Include all resource types with accurate availability. Set up different
  allocation rules for various employment types.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="How detailed should planning be?">
  Plan at the week level for near-term (4 weeks) and month level for
  longer-term. Too much detail creates rigidity.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should we track non-billable time?">
    Yes! Understanding total capacity including admin, sales, and development time provides accurate planning.
