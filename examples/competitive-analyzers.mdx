## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do we get competitor data legally?">
    Use publicly available data from tools like SEMrush, social media APIs, and web scraping of public information. Always respect robots.txt and terms of service.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the data isn't 100% accurate?">
    Position estimates as directional insights. Include disclaimers about data sources and limitations. Focus on relative comparisons rather than absolute numbers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many competitors should we analyze?">
    Start with 3-5 direct competitors. Too many creates analysis paralysis; too few doesn't provide enough context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should we show where prospects are winning?">
    Yes! Showing strengths builds trust and makes gaps more credible. It also helps prioritize where to focus improvements.
