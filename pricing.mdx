## Why Not Just...?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why not hire a full-time developer?">
    **Cost:** $150K+ per year + benefits + recruiting time + ramp-up period

    **WithSeismic:** $90K per year, no benefits, no recruiting, start immediately with 15+ years of automation experience

    **Reality:** A junior/mid developer will take 3-6 months to deliver what we ship in weeks. Senior developers with automation expertise cost $180K+ and are nearly impossible to hire.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why not use Zapier or Make?">
    **What they're good for:** Simple workflows between popular apps (Slack → Google Sheets)

    **What they can't do:** Chrome extensions, browser automation, custom UI, complex logic, AI workflows at scale, systems that drive real revenue

    **When to choose us:** When your needs are too complex for no-code tools. When you need custom tools that become competitive advantages, not just basic integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why not Upwork or freelancers?">
    **Freelancers build what you ask for.** We figure out what actually needs to be built.

    **Risk:** Code quality varies wildly. No accountability after delivery. You're managing project managers instead of getting results.

    **Us:** Production-ready code. Ongoing partnership. We've shipped systems that drove 60% of revenue and contributed to acquisitions. You get the same person who built for Contra and Groupon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why not wait / do nothing?">
    **Every quarter you wait:**
    - Your team wastes another 60% of their time on manual work
    - Competitors building automation pull further ahead
    - You spend another $30K-50K on manual labor that could be automated
    - Hiring more people to do the same repetitive tasks

    **The compounding cost of doing nothing is higher than $22,500.**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why $22,500 Minimum?

<Info>
  **Quality over quick fixes.** At $7,500/month for 3 months minimum, we're not competing with freelancers or contractors. We're growth engineers who become part of your team. This investment ensures we can dive deep, build multiple tools, iterate based on real usage, and deliver transformation—not just features.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why 3 months minimum?">
    Real transformation takes time. Month 1 is discovery and initial tools. Month 2 is expansion based on what works. Month 3 is optimization and scale. Quick fixes don't create competitive advantages.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What if we need something smaller?">
  We occasionally take on strategic smaller projects for the right fit, but our
  sweet spot is comprehensive partnerships. For quick fixes, we recommend
  freelance platforms. For transformation, we're your team.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How many tools will we get?">
  Typically 5-10 production tools over 3 months, but we focus on impact, not
  quantity. We'd rather build 5 tools that transform your business than 20 that
  don't move the needle.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can we extend beyond 3 months?">
  Absolutely. Most clients continue with our monthly partnership after seeing
  results. The initial 3 months proves value, then we become your ongoing
  innovation partner.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What's your success rate?">
  100% of our partnerships have delivered positive ROI within 6 months. Average
  client sees 10-20x return within the first year through time savings and
  efficiency gains.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who actually does the work?">
    [Doug Silkstone](https://github.com/dougwithseismic) personally leads all development with a small team of senior engineers. No outsourcing, no juniors learning on your dime.
