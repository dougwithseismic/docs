## Current Pricing (September 2025)

We believe in complete transparency. Here's exactly what our services cost and what you get for your investment.

## Why Our Pricing Makes Sense

**vs. Full-Time Developer**
$120-200K/year + benefits. Our $6K sprint = 2 weeks of senior expertise without the overhead.

**vs. Traditional Consultancies**
$150-300/hour typical rates. We're ~$75/hour with guaranteed deliverables, not open-ended billing.

**vs. Manual Work**
20 hours/week saved = $3K/week value. Your tool pays for itself in 2 weeks.

### Option 3: Freelance Developers

## The Math That Matters

<Info>
  **Example: Lead Qualification Tool**
  - Manual process: 4 hours/day × 5 days × $50/hour = **$1,000/week cost**
  - Our tool investment: $12,000 (4-week sprint)
  - **Break-even: 12 weeks**
  - Year 1 savings: $52,000 - $12,000 = **$40,000 profit**
