## Why Our Pricing Makes Sense

### The Math That Matters

<Info>
  **Example: Lead Qualification Tool**
  - Manual process: 4 hours/day × 5 days × $50/hour = **$1,000/week cost**
  - Our tool investment: $12,000 (4-week sprint)
  - **Break-even: 12 weeks**
  - Year 1 savings: $52,000 - $12,000 = **$40,000 profit**
</Info>

### vs. Alternative Options

**Full-Time Developer**
- Junior: $80-120K/year + benefits = ~$8-13K/month
- Senior: $140-200K/year + benefits = ~$15-22K/month
- Time to productivity: 3-6 months
- Risk: Single point of failure, may lack specific skills

**Traditional Agency**
- Hourly rates: $150-300/hour
- Typical project: $30-120K
- Timeline: 3-6 months with scope creep
- Hidden costs: Project management, meetings, revisions

**Freelancers**
- Rates: $75-150/hour
- Availability: Inconsistent
- Quality: Highly variable
- Support: Often minimal post-launch

**WithSeismic**
- Fixed sprint pricing: Know exactly what you'll pay
- 2-week delivery: Ship fast, iterate based on real usage
- Senior expertise: 10+ years experience, production scale
- Ongoing support: We maintain what we build

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do sprints work?">
    We work in fixed time blocks with clear deliverables. Each sprint includes planning, development, testing, and deployment. You get working software at the end of each sprint, not just promises.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my project takes longer than expected?">
    Our sprint model protects you. After each sprint, you have working software and can decide whether to continue. No open-ended billing or scope creep.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you offer discounts for startups?">
    We don't offer standard discounts, but if you're working on something innovative, let's talk. We occasionally partner on compelling projects.
  </Accordion>
