## Why $25,000 Minimum?

<Info>
  **Quality over quick fixes.** We're not freelancers or contractors. We're
  growth engineers who become part of your team for 3 months. This investment
  ensures we can dive deep, build multiple tools, iterate based on real usage,
  and deliver transformationâ€”not just features.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why 3 months minimum?">
    Real transformation takes time. Month 1 is discovery and initial tools. Month 2 is expansion based on what works. Month 3 is optimization and scale. Quick fixes don't create competitive advantages.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What if we need something smaller?">
  We occasionally take on strategic smaller projects for the right fit, but our
  sweet spot is comprehensive partnerships. For quick fixes, we recommend
  freelance platforms. For transformation, we're your team.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How many tools will we get?">
  Typically 5-10 production tools over 3 months, but we focus on impact, not
  quantity. We'd rather build 5 tools that transform your business than 20 that
  don't move the needle.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can we extend beyond 3 months?">
  Absolutely. Most clients continue with our monthly partnership after seeing
  results. The initial 3 months proves value, then we become your ongoing
  innovation partner.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What's your success rate?">
  100% of our partnerships have delivered positive ROI within 6 months. Average
  client sees 10-20x return within the first year through time savings and
  efficiency gains.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who actually does the work?">
    [Doug Silkstone](https://github.com/dougwithseismic) personally leads all development with a small team of senior engineers. No outsourcing, no juniors learning on your dime.
