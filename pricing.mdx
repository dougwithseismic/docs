## Are We a Good Fit?

Before we talk numbers, let's make sure we're right for each other. Answer 5 quick questions to see if we should work together.

<QualifyingQuiz />

## How We Price

Our daily rate is **$750 USD**, typically structured as monthly retainers starting at **$7,500/month**.

We scope projects based on your revenue goals and the engineering required to achieve them. Most engagements start with 1-3 months to prove value, then continue month-to-month as we optimize and expand.

### What This Looks Like

**Initial Engagement**

Starting at $7,500/month for focused revenue engineering projects. We build what's needed to solve your specific revenue problems—whether that's automation tools, Chrome extensions, workflow systems, or custom integrations.

**Ongoing Partnership**

Month-to-month after the initial engagement. Continuous improvement, new features, priority support, and proactive optimization as your business evolves.

## Why Not Just...?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why not hire a full-time developer?">
    **Cost:** $150K+ per year + benefits + recruiting time + ramp-up period

    **WithSeismic:** $90K per year, no benefits, no recruiting, start immediately with 15+ years of automation experience

    **Reality:** A junior/mid developer will take 3-6 months to deliver what we ship in weeks. Senior developers with automation expertise cost $180K+ and are nearly impossible to hire.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why not use Zapier or Make?">
    **What they're good for:** Simple workflows between popular apps (Slack → Google Sheets)

    **What they can't do:** Chrome extensions, browser automation, custom UI, complex logic, AI workflows at scale, systems that drive real revenue

    **When to choose us:** When your needs are too complex for no-code tools. When you need custom tools that become competitive advantages, not just basic integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why not Upwork or freelancers?">
    **Freelancers build what you ask for.** We figure out what actually needs to be built.

    **Risk:** Code quality varies wildly. No accountability after delivery. You're managing project managers instead of getting results.

    **Us:** Production-ready code. Ongoing partnership. We've shipped systems that drove 60% of revenue and contributed to acquisitions. You get the same person who built for Contra and Groupon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why not wait / do nothing?">
    **Every quarter you wait:**
    - Your team wastes another 60% of their time on manual work
    - Competitors building automation pull further ahead
    - You spend another $30K-50K on manual labor that could be automated
    - Hiring more people to do the same repetitive tasks

    **The compounding cost of doing nothing adds up fast.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why not just vibe code it?">
    Everything seems simple if you're new to the space, but as soon as you start building this stuff at scale, you'll find it's all going to fall over. This is the trap that everyone is falling into right now. It's the one that you need to worry about—or one that I'm here to help you not worry about by moving through that complexity with you.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why Project-Based Scoping?

<Info>
  **Revenue problems, not feature lists.** We're not competing with freelancers who build what you ask for. We're revenue engineers who figure out what actually needs to be built. Project scoping ensures we focus on solving your business problem, not just shipping features.
</Info>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do you scope projects?">
    We start by understanding your revenue problem, then scope the engineering required to solve it. You're not paying for a fixed number of tools—you're paying to solve a specific business problem with code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if we need something smaller?">
    We occasionally take on strategic smaller projects for the right fit, but our sweet spot is comprehensive partnerships. For quick fixes, we recommend freelance platforms. For transformation, we're your team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do engagements typically last?">
    Most engagements start with 1-3 months to prove value and solve the initial revenue problem. After that, most clients continue month-to-month as we optimize and tackle new opportunities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's your success rate?">
    100% of our partnerships have delivered positive ROI within 6 months. Average client sees 10-20x return within the first year through time savings and efficiency gains.
