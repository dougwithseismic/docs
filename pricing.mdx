<CostComparison />

### The Math That Matters

<Info>
  **Example: Lead Qualification Tool**
  - Manual process: 4 hours/day × 5 days × $50/hour = **$1,000/week cost**
  - Our 4-week sprint: $20,000 investment
  - **Break-even: 20 weeks**
  - Year 1 savings: $52,000 - $20,000 = **$32,000 profit**
  - Compared to hiring a developer at $150/hour: Save **$4,000** on the same project
</Info>

## Common Project Types

### 2-Week Sprints ($10,000)
- Chrome extension MVPs
- Simple automation scripts
- Web scrapers and data collectors
- Basic LLM integrations
- Proof of concepts

### 4-Week Sprints ($20,000)
- Production-ready Chrome extensions
- Complex browser automation (Playwright)
- LLM workflow systems
- MCP server implementations
- Multi-step automation pipelines

### Custom Projects
For larger initiatives, we combine multiple sprints with clear milestones. Every 2-4 weeks, you get working software to evaluate before continuing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why this pricing?">
    Our $125/hour rate is 40-60% less than typical boutique agencies while delivering senior engineering expertise (10+ years), proven track record, and guaranteed delivery. You're investing in business transformation, not just development hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do sprints work?">
    We start Monday, ship working software by sprint end. Daily updates via Slack. You can test and use the tool throughout development. No surprises, no scope creep.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my project needs more time?">
    After each sprint, you have working software. Decide if you want to continue, pivot, or stop. You're never locked into anything beyond the current sprint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you offer discounts?">
    Our pricing is fixed to ensure consistent quality and dedication to every project. The value comes from ROI—most tools pay for themselves within 3 months.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about ongoing maintenance?">
    $5,000/month provides dedicated support for updates, fixes, and improvements. Most clients start with a sprint, then transition to monthly support once the tool proves its value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you guarantee results?">
    We guarantee working software that meets agreed specifications. We can't guarantee business outcomes (like user adoption), but our track record speaks for itself.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What technologies do you use?">
    TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, Chrome Extensions API, Playwright, LLMs (GPT-4, Claude), and whatever else makes sense for your needs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who actually builds the tools?">
    Doug Silkstone personally leads all development. Not outsourced, not junior developers. You get senior expertise on every line of code.
