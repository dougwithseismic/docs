## ROI-Focused Development

<Info>
**What's the typical return on investment?**
Most automation tools deliver 10-20x ROI within the first year. A $20,000 investment that saves 20 hours per week pays for itself in just 3-4 months.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Example: Process Automation Impact**
  - Manual process: 4 hours/day × 5 days = 20 hours/week saved
  - 4-week sprint investment: $20,000
  - Typical break-even: 3-6 months
  - Long-term value: Exponential time savings and scalability
</Info>

## Common Project Types
