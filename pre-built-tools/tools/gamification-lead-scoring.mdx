## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is this different from Google Analytics?">
    This system focuses on individual visitor qualification, not aggregate metrics. It provides real-time scoring, gamification, and direct sales triggers that GA cannot offer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it slow down my website?">
    No, the entire library is under 15KB and runs asynchronously. It has zero impact on page load times or Core Web Vitals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can visitors see their scores?">
    You can choose to show or hide the profile component. Many sites show it to increase engagement through transparency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about privacy regulations?">
    The system is GDPR/CCPA compliant by default. It tracks behaviors, not personal data, and stores everything client-side unless you explicitly send it to your servers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the achievements?">
    Yes, you can create unlimited custom achievements with your own icons, messages, and trigger conditions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can I implement this?">
    Basic implementation takes 1-2 hours. Full customization and integration typically takes 2-3 days.
