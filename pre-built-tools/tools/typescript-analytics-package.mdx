## Plugin Development

Creating custom plugins is straightforward with our typed plugin system:

```typescript
import { Plugin, Event } from '@your-org/analytics';

export const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-custom-plugin',

  initialize: async (config) => {
    // Setup code
  },

  track: async (event: Event) => {
    // Process tracking event
    return event; // or transform it
  },

  identify: async (userId, traits) => {
    // Handle user identification
  },

  page: async (properties) => {
    // Handle page views
  }
};
```
