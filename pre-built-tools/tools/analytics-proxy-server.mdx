</Card>

## The Problem It Solves

### Current Analytics Challenges
- **30-50% of users** block Google Analytics and other third-party trackers
- **Safari ITP** limits third-party cookies to 7 days
- **Privacy regulations** make third-party data risky
- **Data ownership** remains with analytics providers, not you
- **Cross-domain tracking** becomes increasingly difficult

### Our Solution
Deploy analytics through your own subdomain (e.g., `analytics.yourdomain.com`) to achieve:
- **100% data collection** - Ad blockers can't detect first-party requests
- **Permanent cookies** - No ITP restrictions on your own domain
- **Complete ownership** - Your data lives on your servers
- **Privacy compliance** - Full control over data handling
- **Enhanced accuracy** - No sampling or data limits

## Key Features

### First-Party Data Collection
Transform third-party analytics into first-party data:
