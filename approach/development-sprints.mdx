## From Repetitive Work to Automated Systems

<Info>
  **What's the difference between your sprints and regular development?** We
  build real working automation your team uses immediately - not prototypes or
  demos. Our sprints deliver functional tools in weeks that handle actual work.
</Info>

We don't build prototypes or MVPs. We build real, working automation that your team uses immediately. Our sprint approach delivers functional tools in weeks that handle actual work, not demos that look good in presentations.

## Sprint Structure Overview

<Info>
  **Which sprint option should I choose?** 2-Week Sprint ($12K) builds one tool
  that eliminates a major time sink. 4-Week Sprint ($25K) transforms entire
  workflows with 2-3 connected tools and LLM integration.
</Info>

### 2-Week or 4-Week Sprints

We offer two focused sprint options:

**2-Week Quick Win Sprint ($12K)**

- Build one internal tool that eliminates a major time sink
- Perfect for testing the approach with immediate ROI
- Typically saves 20+ hours/week instantly
- Working tool deployed by end of sprint

**4-Week Transformation Sprint ($25K)**

- Build 2-3 connected tools with LLM integration
- Transform an entire workflow from manual to automated
- Include initial productization if desired
- Complete elimination of a repetitive process

## Sprint Planning: What Gets Built

### Pre-Sprint: The Hit List

Before coding starts, we identify exactly what to automate:

**The Biggest Time Wasters**

- That research process taking 2 days? Now 15 minutes
- The report generation eating Fridays? Automated
- Quality checks taking hours? Real-time validation
- Data entry across 10 tools? One-click sync

**LLM Integration Points**

- Where human judgment seems required (but isn't)
- Unstructured data that needs processing
- Pattern recognition and analysis
- Content generation and synthesis

**Success Criteria**

- Hours saved per week (minimum 20)
- Tasks fully automated (no human intervention)
- Error reduction (catch more, fix faster)
- Team happiness (no more grunt work)

## Sprint Execution: Building Fast

<Info>
  **How do you build production-ready tools so quickly?** We focus on the 80%
  that's predictable, ship fast and iterate based on usage. Perfect is the enemy
  of done - we deliver working tools from day one.
</Info>

### Week 1: Core Automation

**Days 1-2: Kill the Biggest Pain**

- Map the workflow everyone hates most
- Build the core automation logic
- Connect to your existing tools
- Get basic version working

**Days 3-5: Make It Real**

- Handle the edge cases
- Add error handling
- Test with actual data
- Deploy for internal testing

### Week 2: Add Intelligence

**Days 6-8: LLM Enhancement**

- Add AI for complex decision-making
- Train on your specific use cases
- Implement context understanding
- Handle nuanced scenarios

**Days 9-10: Ship and Iterate**

- Deploy to production
- Train your team (takes minutes)
- Gather immediate feedback
- Plan next automation target

## Development Approach

### Build for Reality, Not Perfection

We focus on what actually matters:

**The 80/20 Rule**

- Automate the 80% that's predictable
- Leave the 20% edge cases for humans (for now)
- Ship fast, iterate based on usage
- Perfect is the enemy of done

**LLM-First Architecture**

- Use AI where it adds value, not everywhere
- Context understanding over rigid rules
- Adaptive systems that learn from use
- Fallbacks for when AI gets confused

### Production-Ready from Day One

No prototypes, only working tools:

**Immediate Deployment**

- Tools your team uses while we build
- Real data, real workflows, real results
- Feedback loops measured in hours, not weeks
- Continuous improvement based on actual use

**Built to Scale**

- Handle your current load and 10x more
- Security and compliance from the start
- Integration with your existing stack
- Documentation your team actually reads

## Working Together During Sprints

### You're Involved, Not Overwhelmed

We keep you informed without drowning you in meetings:

**async Updates That Matter**

- Daily Slack/email: "Here's what we automated today"
- Weekly demo: "Look what your tool can do now"
- Instant alerts: Only if we're blocked
- No status meetings about status meetings

**Your Team's Input**

- They test while we build
- Immediate feedback gets immediate fixes
- "This would save more time if..." becomes reality
- They shape the tool they'll actually use

### Sprint Completion

Each sprint ends with results, not reports:

**What You Get**

- Working tool deployed and in use
- Hours already saved this week
- Training (usually takes 10 minutes)
- Clear ROI calculation

**What's Next**

- Next workflow to automate
- Additional LLM enhancements
- Productization opportunities
- Scaling to more team members

## What We Actually Build

### Internal Tools That Work

Real automation your team uses daily:

- **Research Aggregators** - Pull from 20 sources in seconds
- **Report Generators** - Transform data into client-ready docs
- **Quality Checkers** - Catch errors before clients do
- **Data Processors** - No more copy-paste marathons

### LLM Enhancements That Think

AI that handles complexity:

- **Context Understanding** - Knows your client's industry
- **Pattern Recognition** - Spots trends humans miss
- **Content Generation** - First drafts in your voice
- **Decision Support** - Recommendations based on data

## Sprint Deliverables

### What You Get Every Sprint

Tangible results, not promises:

**Working Automation**

- Tools in production, being used
- Hours saved starting immediately
- Processes eliminated permanently
- Team freed up for real work

**Everything You Need**

- Simple training (if it takes more than 10 minutes, we failed)
- Integration with your existing tools
- Support for when things break
- Clear path to more automation

## When Things Change

### Flexibility Without Chaos

Your needs change, our sprints adapt:

**Mid-Sprint Discoveries**

- "We just realized X wastes more time" - We pivot
- "The team needs Y more urgently" - We adjust
- "Can it also do Z?" - We scope it
- "This isn't working" - We fix it

**No Surprise Pricing**

- Sprint price is fixed, scope is flexible
- Trade-offs clearly communicated
- Additional sprints for additional features
- You're always in control

## Success Metrics

<Info>
  **How do you measure sprint success?** We track impact, not activity - hours
  reclaimed this week, tasks no longer done manually, projects completed faster,
  and weekends no longer worked.
</Info>

### What Actually Matters

We measure impact, not activity:

**Time Saved**

- Hours reclaimed this week
- Tasks no longer done manually
- Projects completed faster
- Weekends no longer worked

**Quality Improved**

- Errors caught automatically
- Consistency across deliverables
- Faster turnaround times
- Happier team members
