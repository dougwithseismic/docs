## Understanding Your Agency's DNA

Every agency has unique processes, methodologies, and deliverables that make them successful. Our discovery process is designed to uncover the repeatable elements in your service delivery that can become powerful productized tools.

## Phase 1: Business Model Deep Dive

We start by mapping your current service offerings to understand:

- **Client Interaction Points** - Where clients need ongoing access to your insights

### Revenue Pattern Identification
Through detailed analysis, we identify:
- Services with the highest profit margins
- Deliverables that clients reference months after delivery
- Processes that could scale without proportional increases in labor
- Opportunities for recurring revenue vs. project-based billing

## Phase 2: Methodology Extraction

### Process Documentation Sessions
We conduct structured interviews with your team to document:

**Strategic Frameworks**
