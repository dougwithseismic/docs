## Finding the Time Drains

<Info>
  **How do you identify which processes to automate first?** We start with time
  audits and pain point discovery to find tasks your team does identically for
  every client - the repetitive work that wastes 20+ hours weekly.
</Info>

Your team didn't join your agency to do data entry. They joined to solve problems, create strategies, and deliver transformative results. Our process mapping identifies exactly where they're wasting time on repetitive work that machines should handle.

## Phase 1: Time Audit & Pain Point Discovery

<Info>
  **What's the real cost of manual work in my business?** We calculate hours
  spent on repetitive tasks, salary cost of non-strategic work, project delays
  from manual processing, and opportunity cost of talent doing grunt work.
</Info>

### Where Your Team Actually Spends Time

We start by analyzing your workflows to uncover:

- **The Copy-Paste Marathon** - Tasks your team does identically for every client
- **The Research Black Holes** - Hours spent gathering data from multiple sources
- **The Template Treadmill** - Reports and deliverables that follow the same structure
- **The Quality Check Grind** - Manual reviews that catch the same types of errors

### The Real Cost of Manual Work

Through time tracking and analysis, we calculate:

- Hours per week spent on repetitive tasks
- Salary cost of work that adds no strategic value
- Project delays caused by manual processing
- Opportunity cost of talent doing grunt work

## Phase 2: Workflow Documentation

<Info>
  **How do you map workflows that aren't formally documented?** We shadow your
  team to document the actual work - the unofficial "way we do things", hidden
  patterns, and quality checks that everyone follows but nobody wrote down.
</Info>

### Mapping the Actual Work

We shadow your team to document exactly how work gets done:

**The Repetitive Reality**

- Watching your strategist spend Monday gathering competitor data
- Observing analysts copying numbers between 12 different spreadsheets
- Tracking how many times the same research gets redone
- Counting the hours spent formatting reports nobody reads

**The Hidden Patterns**

- Steps everyone follows but nobody documented
- The unofficial "way we do things" that actually works
- Quality checks that catch 90% of errors
- Data sources everyone uses but manually accesses

**The Automation Opportunities**

- Tasks that follow identical steps every time
- Research that pulls from the same sources
- Calculations that use the same formulas
- Reports that follow the same structure

## Phase 3: Automation Priority Matrix

<Info>
  **How do you decide what gets automated first?** We prioritize by time saved
  versus effort required - focusing on tasks that waste 20+ hours weekly, quick
  wins that can be automated in days, and processes everyone hates doing
  manually.
</Info>

### What Gets Built First

We prioritize based on immediate impact:

**Time Saved vs. Effort Required**

- Tasks that waste 20+ hours weekly get priority
- Quick wins that can be automated in days, not months
- Processes everyone hates doing manually
- Work that causes the most employee frustration

**LLM Enhancement Potential**

- Tasks requiring context understanding (perfect for LLMs)
- Work involving unstructured data processing
- Analysis and pattern recognition
- Content generation and synthesis

**ROI Calculation**

- Hours saved per week Ã— hourly cost = immediate savings
- Capacity freed up for higher-value work
- Reduction in overtime and weekend work
- Decreased employee turnover from burnout

## Phase 4: Build Strategy

### From Manual to Automated

We create a practical roadmap:

- **Week 1-2 Quick Wins** - Simple automations with immediate impact
- **Month 1 Core Tools** - The heavy-lifting automation your team needs most
- **Month 2 LLM Integration** - Adding intelligence to handle complexity
- **Month 3 Productization** - Packaging internal tools for external use

### Success Metrics That Matter

We track what actually impacts your business:

- Hours saved this week (not theoretical projections)
- Tasks completed without human intervention
- Errors caught by automated QA
- Team members freed up for strategic work

## Our Process Deliverables

### The Automation Blueprint

A practical plan that includes:

- **Time Waste Heat Map** - Visual showing where your team burns the most time
- **Automation Hit List** - Prioritized list of processes to eliminate
- **Tool Architecture** - How your internal tools will work together
- **LLM Integration Points** - Where AI will handle the complex stuff

### The 90-Day Transformation Plan

A sprint-based roadmap:

- **Weeks 1-2** - Build the first tool that saves 20+ hours/week
- **Weeks 3-4** - Add LLM capabilities for intelligent automation
- **Weeks 5-8** - Scale to additional workflows
- **Weeks 9-12** - Package for potential productization

## What Makes Our Process Different

### We've Been in Your Shoes

Unlike generic consultants, we know:

- The soul-crushing reality of repetitive work
- How talented people burn out on mindless tasks
- The difference between work that needs creativity and work that doesn't
- Why your team works weekends (hint: it's not dedication, it's inefficiency)

### We Build, Not Just Advise

Our process mapping is preparation for building:

- We only document what we can automate
- Every finding translates to working code
- We know what LLMs can and can't do
- We've built these tools before

### Results in Weeks, Not Months

Every mapping session drives immediate action:

- Week 1: Identify the biggest time waste
- Week 2: Build a tool that eliminates it
- Week 3: Your team gets hours back
- Week 4: Expand to the next workflow

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do you identify which processes to automate first?">
    We start with time audits and pain point discovery to find tasks your team does identically for every client - the repetitive work that wastes 20+ hours weekly. We prioritize by time saved versus effort required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the real cost of manual work that you help calculate?">
    We calculate hours spent on repetitive tasks, salary cost of non-strategic work, project delays from manual processing, and opportunity cost of talent doing grunt work instead of strategic initiatives.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you map workflows that aren't formally documented?">
    We shadow your team to document the actual work - the unofficial 'way we do things', hidden patterns, and quality checks that everyone follows but nobody wrote down. We observe real workflows, not theoretical processes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes a good candidate for automation?">
