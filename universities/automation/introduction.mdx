## Overview

<Info>
**What is n8n workflow automation?**
n8n is a comprehensive, free and open-source workflow automation platform that allows you to connect APIs, build custom integrations, and automate complex business processes. You can self-host it for complete control, build unlimited workflows, create custom nodes, and scale from side projects to enterprise systems.
</Info>

The comprehensive guide to mastering n8n - from your first workflow to building custom nodes and deploying at scale.

## Why Choose n8n

<Info>
**Is n8n better than Zapier or Make?**
n8n offers complete control through self-hosting, unlimited workflows with no execution limits, custom node creation capabilities, full JavaScript/TypeScript support, and production-ready scaling. Unlike Zapier or Make's pricing tiers, n8n is open-source and free to self-host with no workflow restrictions.
</Info>

n8n gives you:

- **Complete control** - Self-host your automations
- **Unlimited workflows** - No execution limits or pricing tiers
- **Custom nodes** - Build exactly what you need
- **Real programming** - Use JavaScript/TypeScript when visual isn't enough
- **Production ready** - Scale from side project to enterprise

## Learning Outcomes

<Info>
**What n8n skills will I learn?**
You'll master self-hosting n8n on platforms like Railway or Docker, designing complex workflow automations, creating custom nodes in TypeScript, and implementing production operations including backups, monitoring, and scaling strategies.

## Learning Paths

<Info>
**Should I learn n8n no-code or development path?**
Choose the no-code path if you're new to n8n or prefer visual workflow building - you'll be creating automations in hours. Choose the developer path if you want to build custom nodes, integrate proprietary APIs, or need advanced workflow patterns - requires JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge.
</Info>

### Path 1: Getting Started with n8n
Perfect for beginners and no-code users:
- Quick deployment with Railway
- Understanding nodes and workflows
- Connecting services and APIs
- Building your first automations
- Using AI to generate workflows

### Path 2: n8n Developer Course
For developers who want to build on n8n:
- Setting up development environments
- Creating custom nodes in TypeScript
- Advanced workflow patterns
- Production deployment strategies
- Backup and disaster recovery

## What Makes This Different

<Info>
**How is this n8n training different from official docs?**
Real production experience from client projects with complete code and workflow transparency. Battle-tested patterns that work.
</Info>

### Real Production Experience
Every lesson comes from actual client projects and production deployments.

### Complete Transparency
