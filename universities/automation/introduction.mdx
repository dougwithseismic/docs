The comprehensive guide to mastering n8n - from your first workflow to building custom nodes and deploying at scale.

## Why n8n?

n8n is the most powerful open-source workflow automation platform. Unlike closed systems like Zapier or Make, n8n gives you:

- **Complete control** - Self-host your automations
- **Unlimited workflows** - No execution limits or pricing tiers
- **Custom nodes** - Build exactly what you need
- **Real programming** - Use JavaScript/TypeScript when visual isn't enough
- **Production ready** - Scale from side project to enterprise
