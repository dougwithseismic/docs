## Overview

<Info>
**What will I learn in this course?**
Transform from an n8n user into an n8n developer - build custom nodes, deploy production systems, and architect enterprise-grade automation workflows. This course teaches you to extend n8n as a platform, not just use it as a tool.
</Info>

Most n8n tutorials teach you how to drag and drop nodes. This course teaches you how to build them.

You'll learn to see n8n as a powerful platform you can extend and customize to solve any integration challenge - whether building internal tools, creating automation products for clients, or developing SaaS integration strategies.

## What You'll Learn

<Info>
**Course curriculum overview**
Master self-hosting, custom node development, advanced workflow patterns, and DevOps integration through hands-on projects and real-world patterns from production deployments.

## Course Structure

<Info>
**8-week learning path**
Four phases: Foundation (setup and architecture), Node Development (custom nodes), Advanced Workflows (patterns and optimization), Production Systems (deployment and scaling).
</Info>

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Understand n8n's architecture and deploy multiple ways - locally, Docker, and Railway. Each deployment method teaches crucial concepts about how n8n operates in different contexts.

### Phase 2: Node Development (Weeks 3-4)
Build three progressively complex custom nodes:
- **HTTP Bin Node** - Basics of node structure, TypeScript patterns, and execution model
- **Data Processor** - Complex transformations, streaming, and professional UIs
- **Custom Credentials** - Secure authentication systems and organization infrastructure

### Phase 3: Advanced Workflows (Weeks 5-6)
Architect sophisticated workflow patterns with custom nodes:
- Error recovery pipelines that self-heal
- Event-driven systems that scale automatically
- State machines for complex business processes
- Performance optimization for millions of executions

### Phase 4: Production Systems (Weeks 7-8)
Learn what it takes to run n8n at scale:
- Comprehensive backup and recovery strategies
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- High-availability architectures
- Multi-tenant deployments for SaaS applications

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this course suitable for beginners to n8n?

This course assumes you have basic n8n knowledge and want to advance to development. If you're completely new to n8n, start with our basic automation courses first to understand workflows and nodes.

### How hands-on is this course?

Very hands-on. You'll be writing code, deploying infrastructure, and building real projects from day one. Theory is kept to a minimum - we focus on practical skills you can apply immediately.

### Can I take this course if I only know basic JavaScript?

Yes, but you'll need to be comfortable learning as you go. We'll introduce TypeScript concepts as needed, but prior JavaScript experience is essential for success.

### Will I learn to deploy n8n in production?

Absolutely. We cover multiple deployment strategies including Railway, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud providers. You'll learn monitoring, scaling, and maintenance for production systems.

### Are the custom nodes I build shareable?

Yes, you'll learn to package and publish your custom nodes to npm so others can use them. We also cover contributing to the n8n community.

### What if I get stuck on a lesson?

You have multiple support channels: Discord community, weekly Q&A sessions, code reviews, and instructor office hours. No one learns alone.

### How current is the course content?

n8n evolves rapidly, and we update the course regularly. You'll learn current best practices and emerging patterns used in production today.

### Can I use what I learn for client projects?

Definitely. Many students use their new skills for consulting, building internal tools, or creating n8n-based products. The skills are immediately applicable to real-world projects.

### What's the difference between this and n8n's official documentation?

Our course provides structured learning with real projects, while documentation is reference material. We focus on patterns, best practices, and production concerns not covered in basic docs.

### Do you offer any certification upon completion?

While we don't offer formal certification, you'll have a portfolio of working projects and deep knowledge that demonstrates your n8n development expertise to employers or clients.
