## Why We Do This

Most agencies protect their "secret sauce" behind NDAs and sales pitches. We believe:

- **Knowledge should be shared** - The more people who understand these tools, the better
- **Transparency builds trust** - See exactly what we do and how we do it
- **Education creates opportunity** - Learn skills that translate to real work
- **Community beats competition** - We all benefit when knowledge flows freely
