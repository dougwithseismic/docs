## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many shortcuts should I learn at once?">
    Start with 5-10 that solve your biggest pain points. Use them exclusively for a week until they're automatic. Then add 5 more. Within a month, you'll have 20-30 shortcuts in muscle memory - enough to transform your workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do these shortcuts work on all Mac keyboards?">
    Yes, but some differ slightly. MacBook keyboards lack some keys (like Page Up/Down), external keyboards may have different Function key behavior. The core Cmd/Option/Ctrl shortcuts work everywhere.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a shortcut doesn't work in my app?">
    Apps can override system shortcuts. Check the app's preferences for custom keybindings. You can often reassign shortcuts in System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I remap my keyboard keys?">
    Consider remapping Caps Lock to Escape or Control if you don't use HyperKey. Many developers swap Control and Caps Lock for easier terminal use. Use Karabiner-Elements for complex remapping.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I find an app's shortcuts?">
    Most apps list shortcuts next to menu items. Press and hold `Cmd` in many apps to see available shortcuts. CheatSheet app shows all shortcuts for the current app when you hold `Cmd`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are these shortcuts the same on Windows/Linux?">
    No, but there are patterns. Cmd on Mac usually maps to Ctrl on Windows/Linux. Option maps to Alt. Some shortcuts are completely different (like screenshots). Learn the concepts, adapt the keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which shortcuts save the most time?">
    Based on usage data: `Cmd+Tab` (app switching), `Cmd+Space` (launcher), `Cmd+C/V` (copy/paste), `Cmd+Z` (undo), and `Cmd+W` (close). These five account for 50%+ of shortcut usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create my own shortcuts?">
    Yes! System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts lets you add app-specific shortcuts. Raycast and Keyboard Maestro enable system-wide custom shortcuts. BetterTouchTool adds gesture-based shortcuts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Cmd and Ctrl in terminal?">
    In Terminal, Ctrl is used for terminal control (Ctrl+C to stop processes), while Cmd is used for app control (Cmd+N for new window). This split prevents conflicts between terminal and app commands.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I print this cheat sheet?">
    No - use it digitally with Cmd+F to search. Better yet, create your personal cheat sheet with only the shortcuts you actually use. Keep it in Apple Notes or as a pinned tab for quick reference.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Remember**: Productivity isn't about memorizing every shortcut—it's about mastering the ones you use daily. Start with 5-10 shortcuts, use them until they're muscle memory, then gradually add more.
