# Productivity Apps Setup

These essential apps will transform how you interact with your Mac. Each one solves a real problem developers face daily.

<Info>
**The Power Trio**: Raycast (launcher), HyperKey (keyboard modifier), and SuperWhisper (voice input). Together they create a frictionless development environment.
</Info>

## Raycast - Command Center for Everything

<Info>
  **Why replace Spotlight with Raycast?** Spotlight just searches. Raycast does everything - launch apps, kill processes, manage clipboard, run scripts, control system settings, and integrate with developer tools like GitHub and npm. It's like having a command line for your entire Mac.
</Info>

### What It Does
Raycast replaces Spotlight with a powerful command palette that can control every aspect of your Mac. Think of it as a universal remote control for your computer.

### Installation

```bash
brew install --cask raycast
```

Or download from [raycast.com](https://raycast.com)

### Initial Setup

1. **Disable Spotlight** to free up `Cmd+Space`:
   - System Settings ‚Üí Keyboard ‚Üí Keyboard Shortcuts ‚Üí Spotlight
   - Uncheck "Show Spotlight search"

2. **Set Raycast Hotkey**:
   - Open Raycast Preferences
   - Set hotkey to `Cmd+Space`

<Info>
  **Which Raycast extensions are must-haves for developers?** Start with GitHub for repo management, Kill Process for stuck ports, Clipboard History to never lose code snippets, and Coffee to prevent sleep during long builds.

<Info>
  **Can I create my own Raycast commands?** Yes! Write custom scripts in any language (bash, Python, Node.js) and Raycast will run them. Perfect for automating repetitive tasks specific to your workflow.
</Info>

### Custom Scripts

Create your own commands. Example: Kill all Docker containers

1. Create Script: Raycast ‚Üí Create Script Command
2. Add this bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# @raycast.title Kill All Docker Containers

| MDN | `https://developer.mozilla.org/search?q={query}` | mdn |
| Stack Overflow | `https://stackoverflow.com/search?q={query}` | so |

## HyperKey - Unlock Your Caps Lock

<Info>
  **What's the point of HyperKey?** Your Caps Lock key is prime keyboard real estate doing nothing useful. HyperKey turns it into a "Hyper" modifier (Cmd+Option+Ctrl+Shift), giving you hundreds of new keyboard shortcuts that won't conflict with existing ones.
</Info>

### What It Does
Transforms your useless Caps Lock key into a powerful modifier (Cmd+Option+Ctrl+Shift) that gives you endless shortcut possibilities.

### Installation

Download from [hyperkey.app](https://hyperkey.app) (Free)

### Setup

1. Launch HyperKey
2. Grant accessibility permissions when prompted
3. Caps Lock is now your Hyper key!

<Info>
  **How do I set up HyperKey shortcuts?** After installing HyperKey, your Caps Lock becomes the Hyper key. Then use System Settings or Raycast to assign Hyper+[key] combinations to any action. No conflicts with existing shortcuts!
</Info>

### Configure System Shortcuts

System Settings ‚Üí Keyboard ‚Üí Keyboard Shortcuts ‚Üí App Shortcuts

Add these global shortcuts:

| Application | Menu Title | Shortcut |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| All Applications | Minimize | Hyper+M |
| All Applications | Zoom | Hyper+Z |
| Terminal | New Window | Hyper+T |
| Finder | New Finder Window | Hyper+F |
| Safari | New Window | Hyper+B |

### Raycast + HyperKey Integration

<Info>
  **Should I set up HyperKey shortcuts right away?** Start with just `Cmd+Space` for everything. Once you're comfortable and notice which apps/commands you use most, then add HyperKey shortcuts for those specific items using Raycast's hotkey feature.
</Info>

Once you're comfortable with Raycast, set up direct shortcuts:

1. **In Raycast preferences** ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Search for any command
2. **Click the hotkey field** next to the command
3. **Press Hyper + [your chosen key]**

Recommended shortcuts to set up (after you're comfortable):

| Extension/App | Hotkey | Purpose |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Clipboard History | Hyper+V | Quick paste from history |
| VS Code | Hyper+C | Open VS Code instantly |
| Terminal | Hyper+T | New terminal window |
| Browser | Hyper+B | Open browser |
| GitHub | Hyper+G | GitHub search |
| Slack | Hyper+S | Switch to Slack |

**Remember**: Start with `Cmd+Space` for everything. Add HyperKey shortcuts only for your most-used items after a week or two of using Raycast.

## SuperWhisper - Voice to Text Everywhere

<Info>
  **Why use SuperWhisper instead of Mac's built-in dictation?** SuperWhisper uses OpenAI's Whisper model for superior accuracy, especially with technical terms. It works offline, supports custom vocabulary, and transcribes much faster than Apple's dictation.
</Info>
