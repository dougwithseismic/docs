## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to install all these apps?">
    No, start with Raycast as it provides the most immediate productivity boost. Add HyperKey if you want more keyboard shortcuts, SuperWhisper if you prefer voice input, and Proxyman when you need to debug network requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will Raycast slow down my Mac?">
    No, Raycast is incredibly lightweight and actually faster than Spotlight. It uses minimal RAM and CPU, with most extensions running on-demand only when you invoke them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my existing Spotlight shortcuts with Raycast?">
    Yes! Just disable Spotlight's Cmd+Space shortcut in System Settings, then set Raycast to use Cmd+Space. All your muscle memory transfers instantly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I accidentally trigger Caps Lock while typing?">
    HyperKey has a built-in delay - quick taps still work as Escape (or can be disabled entirely), while holding it activates the Hyper modifier. You can adjust the timing in HyperKey preferences.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does SuperWhisper work offline?">
    Yes! SuperWhisper can work completely offline using the built-in models. The offline mode is perfect for privacy-sensitive content or when you're without internet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can SuperWhisper transcribe technical jargon and code?">
    Yes, SuperWhisper handles technical terms well, especially in Super Mode. You can also add custom vocabulary for project-specific terms, function names, or domain language.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will Proxyman intercept all my traffic?">
    Only when you explicitly enable it. Proxyman doesn't run in the background by default. When active, you can use filters to capture only specific apps or domains.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sync Raycast extensions across multiple Macs?">
    Yes! Sign in with your Raycast account and your extensions, preferences, and snippets sync automatically across all your devices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there alternatives to these apps?">
    Yes - Alfred instead of Raycast, Karabiner-Elements instead of HyperKey, Whisper Transcription instead of SuperWhisper, and Charles Proxy instead of Proxyman. We recommend our choices for their simplicity and developer focus.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much disk space do these apps use?">
    Minimal - Raycast (~100MB), HyperKey (~10MB), SuperWhisper (~500MB with models), Proxyman (~150MB). Together they're less than 1GB, a tiny footprint for massive productivity gains.
