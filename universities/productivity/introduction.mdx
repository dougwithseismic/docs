# Mac Developer Productivity University

**Stop fighting your tools. Start shipping faster.**

Every day, developers waste 2+ hours on repetitive tasks, hunting through menus, and typing the same commands over and over. This isn't just inefficiency—it's creative death by a thousand paper cuts.

The best developers aren't necessarily smarter. They've just eliminated the friction between their ideas and their code.

<Info>
**What you'll learn**: Essential shortcuts, terminal mastery, automation workflows, and the specific tools that turn Mac into a development powerhouse. No fluff, just the shortcuts and systems that actually matter.
</Info>

## Why Mac Productivity Matters

**The Reality**: Most developers use less than 20% of their Mac's capabilities. They click through Finder instead of using keyboard shortcuts. They type `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push` instead of `gacp "message"`. They manually resize windows instead of using snap shortcuts.

**The Cost**: Those extra seconds add up to hours every week. But more importantly, the constant context switching breaks your flow state—the mental space where your best code happens.

**The Solution**: Master the fundamentals once, then compound the time savings for your entire career.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't another "100 Mac shortcuts you'll never use" article. This is a curated system based on real development workflows:

## Coming Soon

We're expanding this university with additional courses:

- **Terminal Mastery**: Advanced shell scripting, custom functions, and automation
- **Git Workflows**: Advanced git techniques, hooks, and team workflows
- **Docker Development**: Container-first development on Mac
- **IDE Optimization**: VS Code, Vim, and JetBrains productivity
- **System Automation**: AppleScript, Automator, and Keyboard Maestro

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Ready to start saving time immediately? Here's your quick setup:

1. **Essential shortcuts**: `Cmd+Space` (Spotlight), `Cmd+Shift+.` (show hidden files)
2. **Git shortcuts**: Add `gac` and `gacp` functions to your shell
3. **Window management**: Install Rectangle app for window snapping
4. **Terminal improvements**: Install Oh My Zsh and better command alternatives
5. **VS Code shortcuts**: Master `Cmd+P` (quick open) and `Cmd+Shift+P` (command palette)

Each of these takes 1 minute to set up and will save you hours every week.

## The Productivity Mindset

**Principle 1: Automate the Repetitive**
If you do it more than twice, write a script or create a shortcut.

**Principle 2: Optimize the Frequent**
Focus on the tasks you do every day, not the edge cases you encounter once a month.

**Principle 3: Build Muscle Memory**
Practice shortcuts until they're unconscious. The goal is to think at the speed of typing.

**Principle 4: Compound the Benefits**
Small improvements compound. A 10-second savings used 50 times a day saves 8+ hours per week.

## Success Stories

> *"After implementing the git shortcuts alone, I'm saving 30+ minutes per day just on version control. The compound effect is incredible."*
>
> **— Sarah Chen, Full Stack Developer**

> *"The terminal productivity techniques transformed how I work. I went from dreading command line work to preferring it over GUI tools."*
>
> **— Marcus Rodriguez, DevOps Engineer**

> *"These aren't just shortcuts—they're a completely different way of thinking about developer workflow. Game changer."*
>
> **— Alex Kim, Tech Lead**

**Remember**: Productivity isn't about speed for its own sake. It's about removing friction so you can focus on what matters—solving problems and building things that matter.

The goal isn't to memorize every shortcut. It's to build a system that gets out of your way and lets you create.
