# Content Improvement TODO

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Do First)

### Pricing Consistency
- [ ] **Fix pricing inconsistency across all pages**
  - Current state: $7.5K/mo (homepage), $12K-25K (about), $12K (quickstart), $6K (old contact)
  - Decision needed: Keep $7,500/month Ã— 3 months = $22,500 model
  - Files to update:
    - [ ] about-withseismic.mdx (lines 466-478)
    - [ ] quickstart.mdx (line 84, 142)
    - [ ] contact.mdx (lines 96-99)
    - [ ] Verify all case studies don't have old pricing

### Value Proposition
- [ ] **Rewrite homepage headline** to focus on outcomes not process
  - Current: "We're an AI-native development team building Chrome extensions..."
  - New: Lead with what clients GET, not HOW you work
  - File: index.mdx (lines 65-70)

### Technical Jargon
- [ ] **Replace tech terms with outcomes**
  - "MCP Servers" â†’ "Connect AI to your business systems"
  - "Playwright automation" â†’ "Automate repetitive browser tasks"
  - "Manifest V3" â†’ Remove or simplify
  - Files: All "What We Build" sections

4. - [ ] **Move testimonials to homepage** (15 min)
5. - [ ] **Remove/hide qualifying quiz** (2 min)

## ðŸŸ¢ Positioning Problems

### Identity Clarity
- [ ] **Pick ONE positioning statement**

  - Recommended: "Growth engineering team for mid-market SaaS"
  - Files: index.mdx, about-withseismic.mdx, all meta descriptions

### Missing Comparisons
- [ ] **Add "Why not just..." section**
  - Why not hire a developer?
  - Why not use Zapier/Make?
  - Why not Upwork?
  - Why not wait?
  - Location: pricing.mdx or about-withseismic.mdx

## ðŸ”µ Content Gaps

### Case Studies Enhancement
- [ ] **Add business context to each case study**
  - Who made the decision and why
  - What they tried before
  - Specific ROI numbers ($X saved, Y% increase)
  - 6-month follow-up results
  - Files: All case-studies/*.mdx

### Urgency Creation
- [ ] **Add urgency elements**
  - "Only 3 new clients per quarter"
  - Seasonal hooks
  - Competitive pressure statements
  - Files: index.mdx, pricing.mdx, contact.mdx

### Emotional Hooks
- [ ] **Add pain-first content**
  - "Your team spends 40% time on work scripts could do"
  - "While you manually process, competitors automate"
  - Location: New section on homepage before "What We Build"

## ðŸŸ£ Conversion Path Issues

### Navigation Simplification
- [ ] **Reduce navigation complexity**
  - Hide "Articles" tab (or move to footer)
  - Hide "Universities" tab (educational, not sales)
  - Hide "Interactive Tools" tab (not core offer)
  - Keep: Our Services, Case Studies, Pricing, Contact
  - File: docs.json (navigation section)

### Qualifying Quiz
- [ ] **Test removing quiz for 2 weeks**
  - Track consultation bookings before/after
  - Files: pricing.mdx (line 61), contact.mdx (line 38)

### Call-to-Action Improvement
- [ ] **Strengthen CTAs across site**

  - Better: "Get free automation roadmap", "See where you're losing 20+ hours/week"
  - Files: All pages with CTAs

## ðŸŸ¤ Missing Elements

### Video Content
- [ ] **Add homepage video**
  - 60-90 second intro
  - Who you are, who you help, what you build
  - One case study highlight
  - Clear CTA
  - Location: index.mdx after headline, before case studies

### Social Proof
- [ ] **Move testimonials higher**
  - Homepage section with 3 testimonials (photos, companies, results)
  - Logo bar of ALL clients (not just 4)
  - Video testimonials (even Loom recordings)
  - Files: index.mdx, about-withseismic.mdx

### Starter Offer
- [ ] **Consider lower barrier entry point**
  - $3K "Automation Audit" - 1 week
  - $5K "Proof of Concept" - Build ONE automation
  - Then upsell to $22.5K partnership
  - Files: pricing.mdx, index.mdx

### Risk Reversal

  - "If we don't identify $100K+ opportunities in Month 1, full refund"
