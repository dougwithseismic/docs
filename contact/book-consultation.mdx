## Project Requirements

### Before Your Call

To make the most of our time together, consider:

2. **Current Tools** - Note what tools and systems you're currently using
3. **Team Size** - Know your team structure and who handles what tasks
4. **Growth Goals** - Have a clear picture of where you want to be in 6-12 months

### What We Need From You

To move fast and deliver 10x value, be prepared to discuss:

- **Your core value proposition** in one sentence
- **What process you repeat** for every client
- **What prevents prospects** from understanding your value
- **What would make someone say** "I need this now"
- **Your timeline and budget** for transformation
