## Ideal Project Criteria

We're selective about the projects we take on. Here's what makes a team ready for transformative automation with WithSeismic.

## You're a Good Fit If...

### You Have Repetitive Work Eating Your Time
- Your team spends 40%+ of time on manual, repetitive tasks
- You have processes that follow clear patterns
- The same workflows get repeated daily/weekly
- You know exactly which bottlenecks are killing productivity

### You're Competing Against Bigger Teams
- You're a challenger brand fighting incumbents
- Your competitors have 5-10x more resources
- You need leverage, not more headcount
- Speed and innovation are your competitive advantages

### You're Ready to Build Technical Leverage
- You view automation as strategic infrastructure
- You have budget allocated ($12K-$25K for meaningful impact)
- You can dedicate team members to adoption
- You're ready to transform how your team works

### You Need Exponential Growth
- Linear scaling isn't enough anymore
- You're losing talent to burnout from grunt work
- You want systems that scale without proportional costs
- You need your team focused on innovation, not administration

## Red Flags (When We're NOT a Fit)

### You Want Generic Solutions
❌ "Just give us ChatGPT but better"
❌ "We need a simple chatbot"
❌ "Can you clone [existing tool]?"

**Why it matters**: We build custom automation for your specific workflows. Generic tools already exist.

### You Don't Know Your Bottlenecks
❌ "We're not sure what to automate"
❌ "Everything is equally important"
❌ "We haven't mapped our workflows"

**Why it matters**: Effective automation targets specific pain points. Without clarity, we can't deliver impact.

### You're Not Ready to Change
❌ "Automate everything but don't change our process"
❌ "Our team won't adopt new tools"
❌ "We just need a quick fix"

**Why it matters**: Transformation requires embracing new workflows, not just adding tools on top.

## Technical Requirements

### From Your Side
- **Process documentation**: Clear understanding of current workflows
- **Data access**: Systems and data sources we'll integrate
- **Decision authority**: Ability to approve direction quickly
- **Early adopters**: Team members excited to test and iterate

### From Our Side
- **Production-grade code**: Built for reliability and scale
- **Advanced automation**: Chrome extensions, LLM workflows, browser automation
- **Integration expertise**: Connect with your existing tools
- **Performance monitoring**: Track ROI and usage from day one

## Sprint Requirements

### 2-Week Quick Win Sprint
- One major bottleneck to eliminate
- Clear before/after workflow
- Measurable time savings target
- Team ready to test immediately
- $12,000 budget approved

### 4-Week Transformation Sprint
- Multiple connected workflows to automate
- LLM integration opportunities identified
- Full process transformation scope
- Adoption plan for entire team
- $25,000 budget approved

## Timeline Expectations

### Week 0: Discovery
- Initial consultation (30 minutes)
- Workflow analysis session (90 minutes)
- Bottleneck prioritization
- Sprint scope agreement

### Weeks 1-2/4: Build Phase
- Working prototype within 48 hours
- Daily progress demos
- Continuous team feedback
- Real data testing throughout

### Post-Sprint
- Production deployment
- Team training sessions
- Performance monitoring setup
- 30-day support included

## What We DON'T Do

### We Don't Build:
- Generic tools you can buy off-the-shelf
- Consumer apps or games
- Simple chatbots or basic integrations
- Malicious automation or scrapers
- Anything that doesn't solve real business problems

### We Don't Work With:
- Teams that won't change their workflows
- Companies looking for cheap dev labor
- Projects without clear ROI potential
- Organizations resistant to automation
- Anyone expecting magic without effort

## Success Metrics

We measure success by:
- **Time saved** - Hours returned to strategic work
- **Speed improvement** - 10x, 100x, or 200x faster processes
- **Error reduction** - 80-95% fewer mistakes
- **Team capacity** - Handle 2-3x volume without hiring
- **ROI timeline** - Typically positive within 30-60 days

## Common Automation Opportunities

### High-Impact Areas We Transform:
- **Research & Intelligence** → LLM-powered analysis ([Fingers on Pulse case study](/case-studies/fingers-on-pulse-content-intelligence))
- **Lead Generation** → Chrome extensions for discovery ([Contra/Indy.ai case study](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation))
- **Campaign Management** → Programmatic automation ([Vouchernaut case study](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc))
- **Quality Assurance** → Automated testing and validation ([GrowthRunner case study](/case-studies/growthrunner-devtools))
- **Content Operations** → AI-powered creation workflows
