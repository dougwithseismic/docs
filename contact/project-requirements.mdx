## Ideal Project Criteria

We're selective about the projects we take on. Here's what makes a team ready for transformative automation with WithSeismic.

## You're a Good Fit If...

### You Have Repetitive Work Eating Your Time
- Your team spends 40%+ of time on manual, repetitive tasks
- You have processes that follow clear patterns
- The same workflows get repeated daily/weekly
- You know exactly which bottlenecks are killing productivity

### You're Competing Against Bigger Teams
- You're a challenger brand fighting incumbents
- Your competitors have 5-10x more resources
- You need leverage, not more headcount
- Speed and innovation are your competitive advantages

### You're Ready to Build Technical Leverage
- You view automation as strategic infrastructure
- You have budget allocated ([view pricing](/pricing))
- You can dedicate team members to adoption
- You're ready to transform how your team works

### You Need Exponential Growth
- Linear scaling isn't enough anymore
- You're losing talent to burnout from grunt work
- You want systems that scale without proportional overhead
- You need your team focused on innovation, not administration

## Red Flags (When We're NOT a Fit)

### You Want Generic Solutions
❌ "Just give us ChatGPT but better"
❌ "We need a simple chatbot"
❌ "Can you clone [existing tool]?"

**Why it matters**: We build custom automation for your specific workflows. Generic tools already exist.

### You Don't Know Your Bottlenecks
❌ "We're not sure what to automate"
❌ "Everything is equally important"
❌ "We haven't mapped our workflows"

**Why it matters**: Effective automation targets specific pain points. Without clarity, we can't deliver impact.

### You're Not Ready to Change
❌ "Automate everything but don't change our process"
❌ "Our team won't adopt new tools"
❌ "We just need a quick fix"

**Why it matters**: Transformation requires embracing new workflows, not just adding tools on top.

## Technical Requirements

### From Your Side
- **Process documentation**: Clear understanding of current workflows
- **Data access**: Systems and data sources we'll integrate
- **Decision authority**: Ability to approve direction quickly
- **Early adopters**: Team members excited to test and iterate

### From Our Side
- **Production-grade code**: Built for reliability and scale
- **Advanced automation**: Chrome extensions, LLM workflows, browser automation
- **Integration expertise**: Connect with your existing tools
- **Performance monitoring**: Track ROI and usage from day one

## Sprint Requirements

### 2-Week Quick Win Sprint
- One major bottleneck to eliminate
- Clear before/after workflow
- Measurable time savings target
- Team ready to test immediately

### 4-Week Transformation Sprint
- Multiple connected workflows to automate
- LLM integration opportunities identified
- Full process transformation scope
- Adoption plan for entire team

## Timeline Expectations

### Week 0: Discovery
- Initial consultation (30 minutes)
- Workflow analysis session (90 minutes)
- Bottleneck prioritization
- Sprint scope agreement

### Weeks 1-2/4: Build Phase
- Working prototype within 48 hours
- Daily progress demos
- Continuous team feedback
- Real data testing throughout

### Post-Sprint
- Production deployment
- Team training sessions
- Performance monitoring setup
- 30-day support included

## What We DON'T Do

### We Don't Build:
- Generic tools you can buy off-the-shelf
- Consumer apps or games
- Simple chatbots or basic integrations
- Malicious automation or scrapers
- Anything that doesn't solve real business problems

### We Don't Work With:
- Teams that won't change their workflows
- Companies looking for cheap dev labor
- Projects without clear ROI potential
- Organizations resistant to automation
- Anyone expecting magic without effort

## Success Metrics

We measure success by:
- **Time saved** - Hours returned to strategic work
- **Speed improvement** - 10x, 100x, or 200x faster processes
- **Error reduction** - 80-95% fewer mistakes
- **Team capacity** - Handle 2-3x volume without hiring
- **ROI timeline** - Typically positive within 30-60 days

## Common Automation Opportunities

### High-Impact Areas We Transform:
- **Research & Intelligence** → LLM-powered analysis ([Fingers on Pulse case study](/case-studies/fingers-on-pulse-content-intelligence))
- **Lead Generation** → Chrome extensions for discovery ([Contra/Indy.ai case study](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation))
- **Campaign Management** → Programmatic automation ([Vouchernaut case study](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc))
- **Quality Assurance** → Automated testing and validation ([GrowthRunner case study](/case-studies/growthrunner-devtools))
- **Content Operations** → AI-powered creation workflows

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if we're not sure what processes to automate?">
    That's exactly what our discovery session addresses. We'll analyze your workflows, identify bottlenecks, and recommend the highest-impact automation opportunities. Many clients start uncertain and end with a clear roadmap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you determine if we're a good fit?">
    We look for three key factors: repetitive processes that eat significant time, willingness to adapt workflows for better results, and realistic budget for meaningful automation. If any are missing, we'll be upfront about it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the automation doesn't deliver expected results?">
    We start with a 1-week proof of concept to validate the approach before full development. This minimizes risk and ensures we're solving the right problem. We also provide 30-day support to optimize performance after launch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you work with teams that have limited technical expertise?">
    Yes, that's our specialty. We build tools for non-technical users with intuitive interfaces and comprehensive training. Your team's domain expertise is more important than technical knowledge.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you handle projects that require integration with existing systems?">
    System integration is core to our approach. We connect with CRMs, marketing platforms, analytics tools, and other business systems you already use. The goal is enhancing your current stack, not replacing it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if our requirements change during development?">
    We build in flexibility through weekly check-ins and iterative development. Minor changes are easily accommodated. Major scope changes are discussed transparently with timeline and cost implications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you provide ongoing maintenance and support?">
    Yes, all projects include 30 days of post-launch support. We also offer ongoing maintenance plans for updates, feature additions, and continued optimization based on your needs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes WithSeismic different from other development agencies?">
    We specialize in automation and productization, not general development. We understand business processes and focus on tools that create competitive advantages. Every project is designed to deliver measurable ROI, not just technical functionality.
