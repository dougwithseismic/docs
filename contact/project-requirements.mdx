## Ideal Project Criteria

We're selective about the projects we take on. Here's what makes an agency ready for productization with WithSeismic.

## You're a Good Fit If...

### You Have a Repeatable Process
- You deliver the same service/methodology to multiple clients
- Your process has clear steps and predictable outcomes
- You've refined it over at least 10+ client engagements
- You could teach someone else to follow your framework

### You Understand Your Value
- You can explain your value prop in one clear sentence
- You know exactly what problem you solve for clients
- You have data on the results you deliver
- Your clients would pay 5-10x more if you guaranteed outcomes

### You're Ready to Invest
- You view productization as strategic, not tactical
- You have budget allocated ($6K-$12K minimum)
- You can dedicate 2-4 hours per week during the sprint
- You're willing to test with existing clients immediately

### You Want to Scale
- You're turning away work due to capacity constraints
- You want revenue that isn't tied to headcount
- You're thinking about exit strategies or valuations
- You want to focus on strategy, not execution

## Red Flags (When We're NOT a Fit)

### Your Services Are Too Custom
❌ "Every client needs something completely different"
❌ "We pride ourselves on bespoke solutions"
❌ "Our value is in the personal touch"

**Why it matters**: Products need patterns. If everything is custom, there's nothing to productize.

### You're Not Clear on Value
❌ "We do a bit of everything"
❌ "We're still figuring out our niche"
❌ "It depends on what the client needs"

**Why it matters**: Products need a clear value proposition. Fuzzy positioning leads to fuzzy products.

### You Want a Magic Bullet
❌ "Build us something that sells itself"
❌ "We don't want to change how we work"
❌ "Just make us a SaaS and we'll be rich"

**Why it matters**: Productization requires commitment to a new business model, not just new tools.

## Technical Requirements

### From Your Side
- **Domain expertise**: Deep knowledge of your methodology
- **Client data**: Examples of deliverables and outcomes
- **Decision authority**: Ability to approve direction quickly
- **Test clients**: 2-3 clients willing to try the productized version

### From Our Side
- **Modern tech stack**: React, TypeScript, Next.js
- **Scalable infrastructure**: Built for growth from day one
- **White-label architecture**: Everything branded as yours
- **Analytics integration**: Measure everything that matters

## Sprint Requirements

### 2-Week Sprint Requirements
- Clear scope for single tool (calculator, assessment, or dashboard)
- Defined inputs and outputs
- Example of current manual process
- 2-3 test users identified
- $6,000 budget approved

### 4-Week Sprint Requirements
- Vision for product suite or platform
- Multiple tools/features defined
- Integration requirements documented
- Launch plan outlined
- $12,000 budget approved

## Timeline Expectations

### Week 0: Pre-Sprint
- Submit qualification (3 minutes)
- Receive response (4 hours)
- Chemistry check (15 minutes)
- Discovery workshop (90 minutes)

### Weeks 1-2/4: Sprint Execution
- Daily progress updates via Slack
- Working code within 48 hours
- Weekly review calls
- Continuous iteration

### Post-Sprint
- Tool deployed and live
- Documentation delivered
- Training completed
- Support handoff

## What We DON'T Do

### We Don't Build:
- Consumer apps or games
- Generic SaaS without your expertise
- Tools unrelated to your core services
- Platforms that compete with your agency
- Anything that doesn't drive revenue

### We Don't Work With:
- Agencies without proven methodologies
- Companies looking for dev shops
- Projects with unclear value props
- Agencies unwilling to test immediately
- Anyone expecting overnight success

## Success Metrics

We measure success by:
- **Tool adoption rate** - Are clients actually using it?
- **Revenue impact** - Does it generate new revenue?
- **Time savings** - Does it free up your team?
- **Client satisfaction** - Do clients prefer the productized version?
- **ROI timeline** - How quickly does it pay for itself?

## Common Productization Opportunities

### High-Success Patterns We've Seen:
- **Audit processes** → Automated assessment tools
- **Strategy frameworks** → Interactive planning tools
- **Analysis methodologies** → Self-serve calculators
- **Onboarding processes** → Client portal systems
- **Reporting templates** → Dashboard generators
