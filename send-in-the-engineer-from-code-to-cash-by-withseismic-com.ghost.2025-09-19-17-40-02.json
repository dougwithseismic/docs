Instead of starting with the problem they need to solve, they often dive straight into tools like no-code platforms.\n\nThis creates brittle systems that fail when faced with real-world complexity or edge cases. These platforms' flashy interfaces and drag-and-drop simplicity give the illusion that automation is easy and universally applicable, but they often lead to inefficiencies and frustration.\n\n\nQ: Why are no-code platforms like Make.com or n8n both helpful and problematic?\n\nNo-code platforms empower non-technical users to create simple workflows without coding knowledge. They democratize automation by making it accessible. However, their limitations are significant:\n\n * Customization Issues: Pre-built nodes rarely handle unique business needs without costly workarounds.\n * Scalability Problems: While some platforms can scale, poorly designed workflows often result in inefficiencies.\n * Hidden Costs: Subscriptions and API call expenses can spiral out of control, especially when automations aren't optimized.\n   Ultimately, these platforms are tools—not solutions—and require thoughtful implementation to avoid becoming bottlenecks.\n\n\nQ: Who are the “false kings\"\" of automation, and why are they problematic?\n\nThe \"false kings\" are automation influencers who sell courses, templates, or pre-packaged solutions while presenting themselves as experts.

They focus on understanding the actual bottlenecks and designing solutions that:\n\n 1. Solve the correct problems.\n 2. Balance human and machine collaboration.\n 3. Build resilient, scalable systems.\n    Unlike influencers who rely on pre-built nodes and templates, engineers have the skills to write custom code, ensuring flexibility and adaptability for complex use cases.\n\n\nQ: What are automation influencers, and why can they be problematic?\n\nAutomation influencers present themselves as automation experts, often through polished demos or online courses. They frequently overpromise and underdeliver, offering incomplete solutions that fail in real-world scenarios. Their lack of deep technical expertise can result in inefficient workflows, high maintenance costs, and systems that break under dynamic conditions or edge cases.\n\n\nQ: How can you identify an automation influencer who lacks genuine expertise?\n\nLook for the following red flags to spot questionable automation influencers:\n\n 1. Vague Claims: They make broad promises about results without providing specific examples or metrics to back them up.\n 2. Overreliance on Tools: They focus on flashy, no-code platforms or pre-built templates rather than addressing underlying business problems. I'm not saying that you shouldn't comment on a free download, but you shouldn't comment on a free download.\n 3.

Start with Problems, Not Tools: Identify inefficiencies before selecting a platform.\n 2. Map Workflows Thoroughly: Understand processes deeply to avoid automating inefficiencies.\n 3. Balance Human Context: Automate repetitive tasks while leaving nuanced decisions to humans.\n 4. Build for Resilience: Invest in scalable systems by writing and owning custom code when necessary.\n\nBy focusing on these principles, businesses can create automation systems that genuinely improve productivity rather than just adding superficial complexity.\n\n\nQ: What's the ultimate takeaway for businesses considering automation?\n\nAutomation isn't about having more colourful nodes or subscribing to expensive tools; it's about solving real problems effectively. Businesses should prioritize thoughtful design over flashy interfaces and seek expertise from engineers who understand scalability, resilience, and human context.

Nowadays, I baulk at putting one character before another. I'm writing less and less code, and speaking more and more instead. Even now, I'm thinking about how much faster it could be to dictate out loud and clean up the mess later. However, by skipping the manual writing process, I'm stealing something from myself—the integral practice and reps required to improve.</p><p>Back in my day, <em>grumble grumble</em>, you were expected to pick up the API reference and slam your head against it repeatedly until you'd mixed and matched enough combinations of example code to call yourself a dumbass and get over your own mistakes. Of course, nobody told me that learning to write software correctly would make this all second nature.</p><p>I stumbled into coding out of necessity, with just the slightest inkling of exposure over the last 30 years. At the time, I did not realize what a character-building exercise this was. But I owe my entire career—my wins, goals, thoughts, everything—to that messy, chaotic journey of falling in love with problem-solving.</p><p>The pain associated with hours spent debugging a well-hidden typo, a misread paragraph, or some random stranger's mistake is a rite of passage. It's one that every engineer, creative, and ambitious human experiences on their climb out of the caves and into the spotlight. It's the secret handshake we share as software developers.</p><h2 id=\"from-necessity-to-obsession\">From Necessity to Obsession</h2><p>My code journey started of necessity—in the trenches of performance marketing, managing thousands of PPC campaigns for a voucher publishing site (later acquired by Groupon). It was the perfect storm of \"I can't be arsed to do this\" meeting \"scratching paint with a toothpick is more fun than what I'm being paid to do right now.\"</p><p>So I did what any procrastinating geek would do—I turned my screen to the wall and my head to the sand. There was no way I would do that work manually,, not when I knew I didn't have to. I'd instead overcome an issue 100x tougher to avoid the dullards of a modern office function—not because someone told me to, but because I had to. I'm too lazy for that—I still am. And that's when another engineer was born.</p><p>It's an opening chapter that many in the martech space share—each going their way toward data, analytics, software, management, entrepreneurship, or everything at once, like mine.</p><h2 id=\"the-evolution-of-a-problem-solver\">The Evolution of a Problem Solver</h2><p>Let's head back several years. I was a little shittling once upon a time—the person I'm warning about in this article.</p><p>Through others' hard work, I found myself forged in fire. In an act of euphoric mania, all my problems turned into nails, and JavaScript became the hammer to beat them down. Much like Smeagol pursuing his precious Ring, knowledge drove me to develop, automate, and create without questioning if I should. I did it because I could, not because I should have. And that's how a problem solver was born.</p><p>Over time, the problems grew more significant and the solutions more intricate. I found myself building to solve problems and creating problems to solve them again. What started as a necessity—a way to skip the hard work—had transformed into an artisanal love affair with code.</p><p>I automated my entire job, then teams of teams. I built my voucher publishing site and automated every second of my time, generating £10,000 per month on autopilot. Not your traditional passive income scheme, but systems and flows that, while flimsy and prone to errors, allowed me to add more weight to the bar—a progressive climb over many years.</p><p>I progressed through analytics, martech, data analysis, product development, and technical sales. I launched multiple businesses and exited twice, using code as my defining weapon.</p><p>The questions never stopped: What's React? How do I host this? What's a server database? Which database?

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the modern-day snake oil for skill development, promising instant expertise while bypassing the messy, critical work of actually learning. Here's why relying on AI tools as a crutch will leave you stranded at the starting line.\n\n[NotepadLM] The Necessity of Reps for True Mastery0:00/768.0241×\n\nDon't get me wrong; I'm the biggest proponent of LLM workflows. Nowadays, I baulk at putting one character before another. I'm writing less and less code, and speaking more and more instead. Even now, I'm thinking about how much faster it could be to dictate out loud and clean up the mess later. However, by skipping the manual writing process, I'm stealing something from myself—the integral practice and reps required to improve.\n\nBack in my day, grumble grumble, you were expected to pick up the API reference and slam your head against it repeatedly until you'd mixed and matched enough combinations of example code to call yourself a dumbass and get over your own mistakes. Of course, nobody told me that learning to write software correctly would make this all second nature.\n\nI stumbled into coding out of necessity, with just the slightest inkling of exposure over the last 30 years. At the time, I did not realize what a character-building exercise this was. But I owe my entire career—my wins, goals, thoughts, everything—to that messy, chaotic journey of falling in love with problem-solving.\n\nThe pain associated with hours spent debugging a well-hidden typo, a misread paragraph, or some random stranger's mistake is a rite of passage. It's one that every engineer, creative, and ambitious human experiences on their climb out of the caves and into the spotlight. It's the secret handshake we share as software developers.\n\n\nFrom Necessity to Obsession\n\nMy code journey started of necessity—in the trenches of performance marketing, managing thousands of PPC campaigns for a voucher publishing site (later acquired by Groupon). It was the perfect storm of \"I can't be arsed to do this\" meeting \"scratching paint with a toothpick is more fun than what I'm being paid to do right now.\"\n\nSo I did what any procrastinating geek would do—I turned my screen to the wall and my head to the sand. There was no way I would do that work manually,, not when I knew I didn't have to. I'd instead overcome an issue 100x tougher to avoid the dullards of a modern office function—not because someone told me to, but because I had to. I'm too lazy for that—I still am. And that's when another engineer was born.\n\nIt's an opening chapter that many in the martech space share—each going their way toward data, analytics, software, management, entrepreneurship, or everything at once, like mine.\n\n\nThe Evolution of a Problem Solver\n\nLet's head back several years. I was a little shittling once upon a time—the person I'm warning about in this article.\n\nThrough others' hard work, I found myself forged in fire. In an act of euphoric mania, all my problems turned into nails, and JavaScript became the hammer to beat them down. Much like Smeagol pursuing his precious Ring, knowledge drove me to develop, automate, and create without questioning if I should. I did it because I could, not because I should have. And that's how a problem solver was born.\n\nOver time, the problems grew more significant and the solutions more intricate. I found myself building to solve problems and creating problems to solve them again. What started as a necessity—a way to skip the hard work—had transformed into an artisanal love affair with code.\n\nI automated my entire job, then teams of teams. I built my voucher publishing site and automated every second of my time, generating £10,000 per month on autopilot. Not your traditional passive income scheme, but systems and flows that, while flimsy and prone to errors, allowed me to add more weight to the bar—a progressive climb over many years.\n\nI progressed through analytics, martech, data analysis, product development, and technical sales. I launched multiple businesses and exited twice, using code as my defining weapon.\n\nThe questions never stopped: What's React? How do I host this? What's a server database? Which database? How can I structure this data? What about TypeScript? Web apps? Mobile? Desktop with Electron and Tauri? What is Rust? Golang?\n\nWhere my marketing career started—selling products others built—I now know how the sausage is made. I now know how to make the sausage myself.\n\nThese were my reps. I put in the hard work. By accident. but still.\n\n\nWhy Struggle Builds Mastery\n\nMuch like development was an addiction that never let me down, I see LLMs becoming that same crutch to many others just starting—equally exciting and dangerous.\n\nIn weightlifting, hypertrophy occurs when muscles are stressed to failure, forcing adaptation. The same applies to engineering:\n\n * A beginner lifter doing 15 reps with light weights builds endurance but minimal strength\n * An experienced lifter doing five heavy reps recruits high-threshold motor units, triggering growth\n\nCoding works the same way. Early in my career, manually debugging thousands of PPC campaigns taught me to spot inefficiencies invisible to automation. The hours spent fixing typos, untangling nested loops, and deciphering API docs weren't wasted—they rewired my brain to think like an engineer.\n\nLLMs shortcut this process. They let beginners generate \"functional\" code without understanding why it works. For example, if you use a weight machine without learning proper form, you'll lift heavier weights but tear your rotator cuff at the first unexpected load.\n\n\nAvoid Shallow Solutions for Deep Problems\n\nLLMs excel at regurgitating patterns but fail catastrophically when faced with novelty:\n\nLogical Blind Spots: They produce syntactically valid but ridiculous code that lacks proper patterns—patterns you only learn through trial and error and experience.\n\nNo Conceptual Grounding: LLMs lack real-world context like an octopus guessing the weather. They suggest outdated libraries or vulnerable dependencies. Anyone who's asked an LLM to set up ESLint knows the struggle with breaking changes, just like those fighting with ESModules vs CommonJS, functional versus OOP, or kebab-case vs camelCase.\n\nOverconfidence in Errors: An LLM, like a consultant, delivers extremely confident wrong answers when unchecked—the kind of confidence that would make you hand over your house keys without hesitation.\n\n\n\n\nWhere Real Engineers Are Forged\n\nDebugging is the ultimate rep-building exercise:\n\nRubber Ducking: Explaining code aloud exposes flawed logic no LLM can catch. You can replicate this with LLMs by conversing about what you need, challenging assumptions, and developing a solid spec document you can confidently reference.\n\nBacktracking: Retracing execution paths builds systems thinking—a skill LLMs lack entirely. This requires your knowledge, expertise, and experience from previous failures. I've watched people frantically copy-paste terminal errors into LLMs repeatedly. I'm guilty, too; sometimes the quick answer seems best when you should be applying knowledge instead of losing it.\n\nEdge Detection: Humans spot edge cases; LLMs amplify biases, creating insecure code and incomplete features. This comes with experience—you must put in the reps. Once you've built that knowledge, you're unstoppable. But if you're deferring all hard work to an LLM, you might build working software, but will you understand it? Can you explain it? Are you using current best practices? These questions matter; they earn you money and respect as a developer.\n\n\nHire Engineers Who've Put in the Reps\n\nThe market is now flooded with \"LLM whisperers\" who have never written a line of code without Copilot. Don't be fooled. The marketing teams behind Windsurf, Replit, Lovable, etc., have convinced everyone that no-code, low-code, and full-code LLM solutions are all they need, as if overnight entire civilizations and even Earth will be torn down and rebuilt in the name of progress.\nUntil they aren't. And you're still struggling with your six hundred lines of context, unable to make progress and taking to Twitter (Fuck Elon) to voice your disdain.\n\nI see a market flooded with juniors who don't know the basics but exude confidence in their deliverables. They're commoditizing code and adding a net negative to the industry.\n\nYou need engineers who:\n\nThink first, code later. Yes, it's thrilling to ship in a day what previously took weeks, but use your gray matter. Put in the reps. Fight knowledge entropy.\n\nAnticipate Failure: We've all believed lies we wanted to hear and gotten burned. The same happens with over-reliance on AI. Think twice before shipping that code or posting that article. Proofread. Add your own experiences, as I'm doing now. My rule: LLMs excel at enhancing thoughts and structuring chaotic inputs, but they can't replace actual thinking. Never defer intelligence.\n\nLLMs have their place—explaining concepts, drafting boilerplate—but mastery demands reps. Real reps. Painful, iterative, human reps.\n\nPut down the chatbot and pick up the API docs. Wrestle with the errors. Log the hours. Or hire someone like me who already has.\n\nNeed systems that scale?

Most developers have horror stories about production queue systems going down at 3 AM because Redis ran out of memory, or jobs silently failing because no one (<em>ahem</em>) set up proper dead-letter queues. You know the pain if you've ever built a system that needs to process thousands of anything.</p><p>For this project, we chose Trigger.dev from the start, which proved to be an A* decision. Instead of spending weeks setting up infrastructure, we could focus entirely on solving the content analysis problem. Trigger.dev offered:</p><ul><li><strong>Built-in queue management</strong>: No need to manage our own Redis instances or job persistence</li><li><strong>Native batch processing</strong>: Support for processing hundreds of items in parallel</li><li><strong>Concurrency controls</strong>: Fine-grained control to prevent API rate limiting</li><li><strong>Robust error handling</strong>: Automatic retries and detailed error reporting</li><li><strong>Development simplicity</strong>: Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A screenshot of Trigger.dev task workflow\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1847\" height=\"1271\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image.png 1847w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Job Queues Never Looked This Good Thanks To Trigger.dev</span></figcaption></figure><p>Our implementation was refreshingly straightforward:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const processYouTubeChannels = task({\n  id: \"process-youtube-channels\",\n  maxDuration: 600,\n  run: async (payload: ProcessYouTubeChannelsPayload) =&gt; {\n    // Create batch payloads for each channel\n    const channelPayloads = payload.channels.map((channel) =&gt; ({\n      payload: { youtubeUrl: channel },\n      options: {\n        queue: {\n          name: \"youtube-channels\",\n          concurrency: 5,\n        },\n      },\n    }));\n\n    // Batch trigger channel scraping\n    const batchResult = await scrapeYouTubeProfile.batchTrigger(channelPayloads);\n    \n    return {\n      success: true,\n      tasksTriggered: batchResult.runs.length,\n    };\n  },\n});\n</code></pre><p>By offloading the DevOps complexity to Trigger.dev's team (who are incredible at what they do), we could focus on building the solution that Fabian's team needed. Trigger.dev has been a fantastic resource throughout this project and I thoroughly recommend baking it into your workflows like ours.</p><h2 id=\"the-one-week-proof-of-concept-testing-the-waters\">The One-Week Proof of Concept: Testing the Waters</h2><p>This project was designed as a one-week proof of concept sprint. The reason we do these short sprints is pretty simple: it allows clients to quickly determine whether an idea has legs without committing to an entire build. In a very short time, Fabian and his team could test the waters, see what life is like in the automation lane, and decide after some rigorous testing whether it was the solution for them or if we should go back and try something else.</p><p>Our proof of concept focused on building a core pipeline architecture:</p><ol><li><strong>Channel Discovery</strong>: Monitors YouTube channels and detects new videos</li><li><strong>Video Processing</strong>: Extracts transcripts and metadata from each video</li><li><strong>Content Analysis</strong>: Uses AI to extract structured insights from the transcript</li><li><strong>Insight Storage</strong>: Organizes and stores the processed insights</li><li><strong>Content Retrieval</strong>: Provides filtered access to processed content by various criteria</li></ol><p>This approach allowed us to demonstrate the potential of automation without building a complete end-to-end solution.</p><h2 id=\"multi-level-batch-processing-the-key-to-scalability\">Multi-level Batch Processing: The Key to Scalability</h2><p>One of the key technical innovations in our system is the use of multi-level batch processing for efficient scaling:</p><ul><li>Level 1: Process multiple channels concurrently</li><li>Level 2: For each channel, process multiple videos concurrently</li></ul><p>This approach allows us to process hundreds of videos simultaneously, dramatically reducing the time required to extract insights:</p><ul><li>Manual approach: 200 videos × 30 minutes per video = 100 hours (or 2.5 work weeks)</li><li>Our system: 200 videos processed in parallel = ~30 minutes total</li></ul><blockquote>This <strong>200x </strong>speedup demonstrates how automation could transform the content research process for Fabian's team.</blockquote><h2 id=\"ai-powered-content-analysis-structured-insights\">AI-Powered Content Analysis: Structured Insights</h2><p>The core of our insight extraction uses AI to analyze video transcripts and extract structured information:</p><p>For each video, we extract:</p><ul><li>Talking Points: Key topics discussed in the content</li><li>Category: Primary content category (Technology, Business, etc.)</li><li>Summary: Concise overview of the content</li><li>Keywords: Relevant terms and concepts</li><li>Learnings: Actionable insights users can apply</li></ul><p>Our initial implementation used a much simpler prompt that just asked for a summary and keywords. The results were disappointing—vague, generic summaries that didn't capture the technical depth needed. After several iterations, we landed on a more structured approach:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const response = await generateObject({\n  model: openai(\"gpt-4o\"),\n  schema: z.object({\n    talkingPoints: z.array(z.string()),\n    category: z.string(),\n    summary: z.string(),\n    keywords: z.array(z.string()),\n    learnings: z.array(z.string()).nullable(),\n  }),\n  prompt: `SECRET PROMPTING TECHNIQUES: ${markdown}`,\n});\n</code></pre><p>When I describe this architecture to other engineers, their first reaction is usually, \"That seems straightforward.\" And that's exactly the point. The architecture <em>is</em> straightforward—almost deceptively so. The complexity lies not in the conceptual design but in the operational details: handling hundreds of parallel processes, managing API rate limits, recovering from failures, and processing gigabytes of transcript data.</p><h2 id=\"system-flows-a-closer-look\">System Flows: A Closer Look</h2><p>To truly understand how our content intelligence system works, it helps to visualize the sequence of interactions between different components. Let's examine some of the key flows that make this system possible.</p><h3 id=\"content-discovery-flow\">Content Discovery Flow</h3><p>The first critical flow is how our system discovers and initiates processing for new content:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"923\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png 923w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This diagram illustrates how we manage the discovery process with efficient batching and state tracking. The system maintains a record of the last processed video for each channel, allowing it to identify only new content that needs processing efficiently.</p><h3 id=\"content-analysis-flow\">Content Analysis Flow</h3><p>Once a video and its transcript are retrieved, the content analysis process begins:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1288\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-2.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-2.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png 1288w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This flow demonstrates how we optimize performance through caching while ensuring reliable processing. The cache dramatically reduces both processing time and API costs for repeated or similar content.</p><h3 id=\"manual-vs-automated-research-comparison\">Manual vs. Automated Research Comparison</h3><p>To appreciate the efficiency gains, let's compare the traditional manual research flow with our automated system:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1282\" height=\"843\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-3.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-3.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-3.png 1282w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Before: Cumbersome.

We cover more ground and process content more quickly and consistently, dramatically reducing the lag between industry developments and our learning content.</p><h3 id=\"why-this-works-the-challenge-of-staying-current-with-frontend-frameworks\">Why This Works: The Challenge of Staying Current with Frontend Frameworks</h3><p>Okay, great. You can skim content. Why does that matter? Here's an example. Consider how quickly the React ecosystem evolves. New patterns, libraries, and best practices emerge constantly. A manual research process would struggle to keep up with:</p><ul><li>Core React updates and new features</li><li>Emerging patterns and community conventions</li><li>Framework integrations (Next.js, Remix, etc.)</li><li>State management solutions</li><li>Performance optimization techniques</li><li>Server component developments</li></ul><p>With our automated system, these developments could be tracked as they emerge, allowing content creators to plan and develop educational material that stays relevant to current industry practices—instead of teaching yesterday's patterns.</p><h2 id=\"technical-challenges-and-solutions\">Technical Challenges and Solutions</h2><h3 id=\"youtube-api-rate-limiting\">YouTube API Rate Limiting</h3><p>YouTube's API has strict rate limits that could potentially block our processing. We addressed this by:</p><ul><li>Implementing channel-based concurrency controls</li><li>Using batch processing to optimize API usage</li><li>Storing processing state to avoid redundant operations</li></ul><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Channel-based concurrency control\noptions: {\n  concurrencyKey: channelId, // Group by channel\n  queue: {\n    name: \"youtube-channels\",\n    concurrency: 5, // Process up to 5 channels concurrently\n  },\n}\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"processing-long-form-content\">Processing Long-Form Content</h3><p>Some videos can be hours long with enormous transcripts. Our solution:</p><ul><li>Process transcripts in chunks to stay within API limits</li><li>Extract the most relevant sections for focused analysis</li><li>Implement caching to prevent redundant processing</li></ul><h3 id=\"ensuring-reliability\">Ensuring Reliability</h3><p>In a system processing thousands of videos, failures are inevitable. We implemented:</p><ul><li>Comprehensive error handling with structured responses</li><li>Detailed logging for debugging</li><li>State tracking to resume interrupted processing</li></ul><p>Again, Trigger.dev made this easy. Deceptively so. Proof of concept Skunkworks projects require extreme delivery speed and accuracy over very short bursts. Trigger.dev is one of the rare tools that does exactly that. </p><h2 id=\"the-universal-content-adapter-pattern-designed-for-expansion\">The Universal Content Adapter Pattern: Designed for Expansion</h2><p>While our initial implementation focused on YouTube content, we designed the architecture to extend to other content sources easily. We implemented a \"Universal Content Adapter\" pattern:</p><pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">interface ContentAdapter&lt;T, U&gt; {\n  // Extract content from source-specific format\n  extract(source: T): Promise&lt;RawContent&gt;;\n  \n  // Normalize to unified content model\n  normalize(raw: RawContent): UnifiedContent;\n  \n  // Process content through insight pipeline\n  process(content: UnifiedContent): Promise&lt;ContentInsights&gt;;\n  \n  // Store results in format suitable for source\n  store(insights: ContentInsights, metadata: U): Promise&lt;void&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre><p>This pattern makes it very straightforward to add new content sources, as they all go through the same processor. We can add new sites, YouTube channels, articles, substacks, etc, with just a couple of lines, and Trigger.dev makes this extremely simple because of how its task system works with queues.</p><h2 id=\"potential-impact-from-manual-to-automated-research\">Potential Impact: From Manual to Automated Research</h2><p>Based on our proof of concept, we projected how this system could transform Fabian's team's content creation process:</p><p><strong>Before Automation (Current State):</strong></p><ul><li>Content research consumes 60% of creators' time</li><li>They monitor 25 YouTube channels regularly</li><li>Content planning is based on subjective impressions</li><li>Content is typically 3-6 months behind the cutting edge</li></ul><p><strong>After Automation (Projected):</strong></p><ul><li>Content research could be reduced to 15% of creators' time</li><li>They could monitor 800+ YouTube channels automatically</li><li>Content planning could become data-driven, based on topic frequency and trends</li><li>Supporting learning content could be come out the same week, or even same day, as published. With most topics being 1-2 weeks at maximum behind the cutting edge.</li></ul><p>This transformation would allow their creators to focus on what they do best—creating engaging, nuanced learning experiences—rather than spending most of their time just trying to stay current.</p><h2 id=\"next-steps-from-proof-of-concept-to-production\">Next Steps: From Proof of Concept to Production</h2><p>While our one-week proof of concept was successful in demonstrating the potential of an automated content intelligence system, there are several next steps to move towards a production solution:</p><ol><li><strong>Building the content dashboard</strong>: Developing a user interface to visualize trends and insights</li><li><strong>Expanding to additional content sources</strong>: Adding LinkedIn, Twitter, and technical blogs</li><li><strong>Enhancing the insight extraction</strong>: Further refining the AI analysis for specific content types</li><li><strong>Implementing user feedback loops</strong>: Allowing content creators to rate and improve insights</li><li><strong>Integrating with existing content management systems</strong>: Streamlining the workflow from insight to content</li></ol><h2 id=\"lessons-learned-the-balance-of-automation-and-expertise\">Lessons Learned: The Balance of Automation and Expertise</h2><p>Throughout this proof of concept, we've learned several key lessons about content intelligence automation:</p><ol><li><strong>Focus on core problems, not infrastructure</strong>: Tools like Trigger.dev let us spend time on our actual content analysis problems rather than queue management</li><li><strong>Pipeline architectures provide flexibility</strong>: Breaking complex processes into composable tasks makes the system more resilient and extensible.</li><li><strong>Smart concurrency is crucial for scaling</strong>: Understanding resource constraints and applying targeted concurrency controls is essential for reliable scaling.</li><li><strong>Structured analysis yields better results</strong>: Providing structure to AI analysis produces more consistent, actionable insights.</li><li><strong>Universal adapters enable expansion</strong>: Our design makes it very straightforward to add new content sources, and they all go through the same processor. Trigger.dev simplifies scaling with its task system and queues.</li></ol><p>The most important lesson was finding the right balance between automation and human expertise. The system isn't meant to replace editorial judgment—it's designed to scale research capabilities so experts can focus on higher-level analysis, curation, and teaching.</p><h2 id=\"curious-about-life-in-the-automation-lane\">Curious about life in the automation lane?</h2><p>If you want to explore what it's like to start baking automation into your product, into your workflow, and what it means for your business revenue, then the one-week proof of concept sprint is a great place to start.</p><p>Visit withseismic.com and book a meeting to get started on your automation journey.

As a learning platform, they needed to ensure their educational content remained relevant, fresh, and aligned with industry trends.\n\nTheir goal was to create content that truly followed the zeitgeist and promoted progression by keeping up with everything happening in the digital space.\n\n\nThe Problem: Always Six Months Behind\n\nThe traditional content research workflow most content teams are using has fundamental flaws:\n\n * Massive time investment: Content researchers spent 60% of their time just trying to stay current\n * Inconsistent analysis: Different researchers extracted different insights from the same content\n * Limited coverage: They could only monitor about 25 channels regularly\n * High latency: Content in specific sectors lagged, anywhere from 3-6 months behind cutting-edge topics; a no-go when dealing with the latest LLM tooling and models.\n * Subjective prioritization: Topic selection was based on what \"felt\" important rather than data — not a problem for the team and their refined taste, but lacking a system to move faster.\n\nFabian's team knew they didn't want to continue with manual methods and accept the risks of being perpetually behind. They needed to find a technical solution to automate their research process.\n\n\nWhy We Chose Trigger.dev: Simplifying Distributed Processing\n\nFrom previous projects, I've spent countless nights wrestling with job queues. Most developers have horror stories about production queue systems going down at 3 AM because Redis ran out of memory, or jobs silently failing because no one (ahem) set up proper dead-letter queues. You know the pain if you've ever built a system that needs to process thousands of anything.\n\nFor this project, we chose Trigger.dev from the start, which proved to be an A* decision. Instead of spending weeks setting up infrastructure, we could focus entirely on solving the content analysis problem. Trigger.dev offered:\n\n * Built-in queue management: No need to manage our own Redis instances or job persistence\n * Native batch processing: Support for processing hundreds of items in parallel\n * Concurrency controls: Fine-grained control to prevent API rate limiting\n * Robust error handling: Automatic retries and detailed error reporting\n * Development simplicity: Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure\n\nOur implementation was refreshingly straightforward:\n\nexport const processYouTubeChannels = task({\n  id: \"process-youtube-channels\",\n  maxDuration: 600,\n  run: async (payload: ProcessYouTubeChannelsPayload) => {\n    // Create batch payloads for each channel\n    const channelPayloads = payload.channels.map((channel) => ({\n      payload: { youtubeUrl: channel },\n      options: {\n        queue: {\n          name: \"youtube-channels\",\n          concurrency: 5,\n        },\n      },\n    }));\n\n    // Batch trigger channel scraping\n    const batchResult = await scrapeYouTubeProfile.batchTrigger(channelPayloads);\n    \n    return {\n      success: true,\n      tasksTriggered: batchResult.runs.length,\n    };\n  },\n});\n\n\nBy offloading the DevOps complexity to Trigger.dev's team (who are incredible at what they do), we could focus on building the solution that Fabian's team needed. Trigger.dev has been a fantastic resource throughout this project and I thoroughly recommend baking it into your workflows like ours.\n\n\nThe One-Week Proof of Concept: Testing the Waters\n\nThis project was designed as a one-week proof of concept sprint. The reason we do these short sprints is pretty simple: it allows clients to quickly determine whether an idea has legs without committing to an entire build. In a very short time, Fabian and his team could test the waters, see what life is like in the automation lane, and decide after some rigorous testing whether it was the solution for them or if we should go back and try something else.\n\nOur proof of concept focused on building a core pipeline architecture:\n\n 1. Channel Discovery: Monitors YouTube channels and detects new videos\n 2. Video Processing: Extracts transcripts and metadata from each video\n 3. Content Analysis: Uses AI to extract structured insights from the transcript\n 4. Insight Storage: Organizes and stores the processed insights\n 5. Content Retrieval: Provides filtered access to processed content by various criteria\n\nThis approach allowed us to demonstrate the potential of automation without building a complete end-to-end solution.\n\n\nMulti-level Batch Processing: The Key to Scalability\n\nOne of the key technical innovations in our system is the use of multi-level batch processing for efficient scaling:\n\n * Level 1: Process multiple channels concurrently\n * Level 2: For each channel, process multiple videos concurrently\n\nThis approach allows us to process hundreds of videos simultaneously, dramatically reducing the time required to extract insights:\n\n * Manual approach: 200 videos × 30 minutes per video = 100 hours (or 2.5 work weeks)\n * Our system: 200 videos processed in parallel = ~30 minutes total\n\nThis 200x speedup demonstrates how automation could transform the content research process for Fabian's team.\n\n\nAI-Powered Content Analysis: Structured Insights\n\nThe core of our insight extraction uses AI to analyze video transcripts and extract structured information:\n\nFor each video, we extract:\n\n * Talking Points: Key topics discussed in the content\n * Category: Primary content category (Technology, Business, etc.)\n * Summary: Concise overview of the content\n * Keywords: Relevant terms and concepts\n * Learnings: Actionable insights users can apply\n\nOur initial implementation used a much simpler prompt that just asked for a summary and keywords. The results were disappointing—vague, generic summaries that didn't capture the technical depth needed. After several iterations, we landed on a more structured approach:\n\nconst response = await generateObject({\n  model: openai(\"gpt-4o\"),\n  schema: z.object({\n    talkingPoints: z.array(z.string()),\n    category: z.string(),\n    summary: z.string(),\n    keywords: z.array(z.string()),\n    learnings: z.array(z.string()).nullable(),\n  }),\n  prompt: `SECRET PROMPTING TECHNIQUES: ${markdown}`,\n});\n\n\nWhen I describe this architecture to other engineers, their first reaction is usually, \"That seems straightforward.\" And that's exactly the point. The architecture is straightforward—almost deceptively so. The complexity lies not in the conceptual design but in the operational details: handling hundreds of parallel processes, managing API rate limits, recovering from failures, and processing gigabytes of transcript data.\n\n\nSystem Flows: A Closer Look\n\nTo truly understand how our content intelligence system works, it helps to visualize the sequence of interactions between different components. Let's examine some of the key flows that make this system possible.\n\n\nContent Discovery Flow\n\nThe first critical flow is how our system discovers and initiates processing for new content:\n\nThis diagram illustrates how we manage the discovery process with efficient batching and state tracking. The system maintains a record of the last processed video for each channel, allowing it to identify only new content that needs processing efficiently.\n\n\nContent Analysis Flow\n\nOnce a video and its transcript are retrieved, the content analysis process begins:\n\nThis flow demonstrates how we optimize performance through caching while ensuring reliable processing. The cache dramatically reduces both processing time and API costs for repeated or similar content.\n\n\nManual vs. Automated Research Comparison\n\nTo appreciate the efficiency gains, let's compare the traditional manual research flow with our automated system:\n\nThese comparative flows highlight how automation has fundamentally changed our research process. We cover more ground and process content more quickly and consistently, dramatically reducing the lag between industry developments and our learning content.\n\n\nWhy This Works: The Challenge of Staying Current with Frontend Frameworks\n\nOkay, great. You can skim content. Why does that matter? Here's an example. Consider how quickly the React ecosystem evolves. New patterns, libraries, and best practices emerge constantly. A manual research process would struggle to keep up with:\n\n * Core React updates and new features\n * Emerging patterns and community conventions\n * Framework integrations (Next.js, Remix, etc.)\n * State management solutions\n * Performance optimization techniques\n * Server component developments\n\nWith our automated system, these developments could be tracked as they emerge, allowing content creators to plan and develop educational material that stays relevant to current industry practices—instead of teaching yesterday's patterns.\n\n\nTechnical Challenges and Solutions\n\n\nYouTube API Rate Limiting\n\nYouTube's API has strict rate limits that could potentially block our processing. We addressed this by:\n\n * Implementing channel-based concurrency controls\n * Using batch processing to optimize API usage\n * Storing processing state to avoid redundant operations\n\n// Channel-based concurrency control\noptions: {\n  concurrencyKey: channelId, // Group by channel\n  queue: {\n    name: \"youtube-channels\",\n    concurrency: 5, // Process up to 5 channels concurrently\n  },\n}\n\n\n\nProcessing Long-Form Content\n\nSome videos can be hours long with enormous transcripts. Our solution:\n\n * Process transcripts in chunks to stay within API limits\n * Extract the most relevant sections for focused analysis\n * Implement caching to prevent redundant processing\n\n\nEnsuring Reliability\n\nIn a system processing thousands of videos, failures are inevitable. We implemented:\n\n * Comprehensive error handling with structured responses\n * Detailed logging for debugging\n * State tracking to resume interrupted processing\n\nAgain, Trigger.dev made this easy. Deceptively so. Proof of concept Skunkworks projects require extreme delivery speed and accuracy over very short bursts. Trigger.dev is one of the rare tools that does exactly that.\n\n\nThe Universal Content Adapter Pattern: Designed for Expansion\n\nWhile our initial implementation focused on YouTube content, we designed the architecture to extend to other content sources easily. We implemented a \"Universal Content Adapter\" pattern:\n\ninterface ContentAdapter<T, U> {\n  // Extract content from source-specific format\n  extract(source: T): Promise<RawContent>;\n  \n  // Normalize to unified content model\n  normalize(raw: RawContent): UnifiedContent;\n  \n  // Process content through insight pipeline\n  process(content: UnifiedContent): Promise<ContentInsights>;\n  \n  // Store results in format suitable for source\n  store(insights: ContentInsights, metadata: U): Promise<void>;\n}\n\n\nThis pattern makes it very straightforward to add new content sources, as they all go through the same processor. We can add new sites, YouTube channels, articles, substacks, etc, with just a couple of lines, and Trigger.dev makes this extremely simple because of how its task system works with queues.\n\n\nPotential Impact: From Manual to Automated Research\n\nBased on our proof of concept, we projected how this system could transform Fabian's team's content creation process:\n\nBefore Automation (Current State):\n\n * Content research consumes 60% of creators' time\n * They monitor 25 YouTube channels regularly\n * Content planning is based on subjective impressions\n * Content is typically 3-6 months behind the cutting edge\n\nAfter Automation (Projected):\n\n * Content research could be reduced to 15% of creators' time\n * They could monitor 800+ YouTube channels automatically\n * Content planning could become data-driven, based on topic frequency and trends\n * Supporting learning content could be come out the same week, or even same day, as published. With most topics being 1-2 weeks at maximum behind the cutting edge.\n\nThis transformation would allow their creators to focus on what they do best—creating engaging, nuanced learning experiences—rather than spending most of their time just trying to stay current.\n\n\nNext Steps: From Proof of Concept to Production\n\nWhile our one-week proof of concept was successful in demonstrating the potential of an automated content intelligence system, there are several next steps to move towards a production solution:\n\n 1. Building the content dashboard: Developing a user interface to visualize trends and insights\n 2. Expanding to additional content sources: Adding LinkedIn, Twitter, and technical blogs\n 3. Enhancing the insight extraction: Further refining the AI analysis for specific content types\n 4. Implementing user feedback loops: Allowing content creators to rate and improve insights\n 5. Integrating with existing content management systems: Streamlining the workflow from insight to content\n\n\nLessons Learned: The Balance of Automation and Expertise\n\nThroughout this proof of concept, we've learned several key lessons about content intelligence automation:\n\n 1. Focus on core problems, not infrastructure: Tools like Trigger.dev let us spend time on our actual content analysis problems rather than queue management\n 2. Pipeline architectures provide flexibility: Breaking complex processes into composable tasks makes the system more resilient and extensible.\n 3. Smart concurrency is crucial for scaling: Understanding resource constraints and applying targeted concurrency controls is essential for reliable scaling.\n 4. Structured analysis yields better results: Providing structure to AI analysis produces more consistent, actionable insights.\n 5. Universal adapters enable expansion: Our design makes it very straightforward to add new content sources, and they all go through the same processor. Trigger.dev simplifies scaling with its task system and queues.\n\nThe most important lesson was finding the right balance between automation and human expertise. The system isn't meant to replace editorial judgment—it's designed to scale research capabilities so experts can focus on higher-level analysis, curation, and teaching.\n\n\nCurious about life in the automation lane?\n\nIf you want to explore what it's like to start baking automation into your product, into your workflow, and what it means for your business revenue, then the one-week proof of concept sprint is a great place to start.\n\nVisit withseismic.com and book a meeting to get started on your automation journey.

The irony isn't lost on me—I've spent a decade helping businesses reimagine their operations while my own agency runs on disconnected tools and manual processes.\n\n[NotepadLM] The Agency's Children Have No Shoes0:00/927.8641×Fingers On The Pulse: How We Ate Thousands Of Hours Of YouTube To Shape The Zeitgeist with Trigger.devYou can’t teach what you don’t know, and you can’t know what you’re not constantly learning yourself.

[NotepadLM] Fingers On The Pulse w/Trigger.dev0:00/867.7441× This challenge isn’t unique to me—it’s something FabianSend In The Engineer: From Code To Cash by withSeismic.comDoug Silkstone\n\nAcross the agency world, this is an issue that all agency owners face at some point—we're extraordinary at delivering services but notoriously bad at optimizing our own operations. We preach automation while drowning in administrative tasks. We sell the future while living in the past. We're the digital equivalent of the cobbler whose children go barefoot.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because we're wired to prioritize client work. We derive deep satisfaction from solving others' problems. And when faced with the choice between improving our own systems or delivering for a client, the client wins every time. We work in our businesses, rarely on them.\n\nIn 2025, I'm changing this pattern for my agency. Not just because it's operationally efficient, but because it's a matter of integrity. How can I claim to transform clients' businesses if I haven't transformed my own?\n\n\nWhy Trust My Vision for 2025\n\nI've been in the automation game for 10-15 years, well before it became today's buzzword. Starting in PPC and performance marketing, I automated over £1 million in ad spend yearly. Through my career, I've optimized campaigns managing between £15-20 million, systematically removing guesswork and human error from the equation. It was a lot less glamorous and node-based back then, with far more hoops to jump through, and definitely not as in-your-face as your LinkedIn feed would have you like.\n\nMoving through MarTech, analytics, and product development, I built and exited two businesses—including a fully automated affiliate voucher site generating £10K monthly with virtually no operational overhead.

right we're going to write some article notes here so I'm just going to dictate to you and then at the end of it think of this story pattern that we should be telling for the article and write down the different sections so that I can flesh out later so I'm writing about a small workshop that I'm running one on one with job seekers called CV surgery; I'm a part of the cv surgery i'm basically teaching job searches job seekers that you have to go to the bottom up approach and just apply to all the jobs yeah it could work you might get there but there's never been more job applications out there you never faced more competition and you never you never had such a low chances of getting the work especially in specific fields that being disrupted right now like in software engineering so I'm showing them the the top down approach I'm showing them the sales development rep outreach approach you know find your list of potential customers use your cv use your keywords use your thoughts work out your hit list of companies that you want to apply for find out signals like what's the headcount growth in the last 6 month such and such a department and then how do we reach out to those guys so that it looks like you really give a **** and your bypass in all of this hellscape I don't know if you've ever applied or sorry I don't know if you've ever posted a job on linkedin or indeed but wow it is not fun at all you're completely quickly quickly overwhelmed with the amount of **** that you're being given and now it's all AI generated **** different flavours of the same looking words and it's really disheartening and it means that if you are a standout candidate you could quite well be buried and if you're a standout candidate that's trying to use applied LLM techniques because you think you'll help you do better and everyone's thinking that and everyone's sounding very similar so they're top down approach with CV surgery so I mislead the title it should be I mean the title of it should be more like hey stop doing job search the way that you're being taught how to do it for the last forever instead act like a sales rep and do it from the top down so anyway this these 1 to 1 sessions at 20 minutes I show a little tool that they put a cv into we get an Apollo list it's very cool it's very fun and they leave the call feeling empowered to go do the job search in a way that's they feel in control instead of just hope and fingers that they put the application in and someone sees it no I did a demo of this and 1 of it was to someone the CFO who was working sorry I was doing a demo and one of the leads that came up was to CFO of a grocery delivery store here in Prague for one of the biggest or the biggest in the country and they got back to me within 10 minutes and saying hey maybe you want to talk to our ai guys about a job sorry it was a great demo for me but then I actually went and I spoke to them and here's what went down. so my background is software development especially in automation and LLM applied LLM stuff right now it's also you know I've been an agency on it well a freelancer turned agency on potentially for nearly 15 years I think I'm not sure probably longer between full-time jobs and I know that the last year also has been the most difficult time ever i've never struggled to find work with the opportunities out there right now I never seemed farther away it's it's quite crazy really so it's always been on me to find the work and the pattern that I've seen always is that as soon as you put yourself out there and you actively go looking for it you won't find the work and this is saved my so many times and continues to do so and when I really need to find the work it's out there you just have to put yourself in the right position with the right tools and artillery and ammo to get the job done so the case studies you have something to be very passionate about talking about when you speak to someone do they do they get it and you know I've done a lot of this but a YouTube channel with a couple years of content now and my dear hub is my gift profile it's absolutely insane loads of work still coding every single day most days I really enjoy it too and I'm working on problems that most people aren't you know the automation space the LLM space sorry I applied LOL space there's a fantastic for me the last time that I did this for the first time I did this so I was not 10 years ago I had a voucher published in some called voucher nought like astronaut but voucher nought and my whole stick there was that I wanted to automate as much as possible using javascript so that was things like building boss that would interact with the Fiat network sites pull out new deals and new offers apply to them covering letters when I get hold of them follow up by email et cetera like this one sounds very trivial now that we know what we can do with a genetic tool flows and we have tools like any tenant make dot com can just code this but 10 years ago you had to build in all of these goods you have to write all of this yourself with your own custom logic and you had to really back and rely on these flaky systems and for the most part it worked so you know II would wake up in the morning and be like wow I didn't even know this brand existed with that paying me for affiliate that's fantastic it's me as a team ended up to me very well we sold that business class actually partner bought it and then we we sold it again so I made some great cash there but yeah so I've always learned how stressful it's been to make money find money and position yourself as an expert and now I'm seeing this new wave of expert who didn't come up through doing the hard stuff like I did and they're doing everything on easy mode and relying on the prompting and outputs and yeah it's still good right it's great i'm just very happy that it's this thing we could for the longest time it was my hill to die open as it is fantastic really absolutely fantastic been able to just recreate fire from fire that you've created something it's insane but um right now I'm dealing with people that haven't gone through the motions of automated the business multiple times they haven't done this for other people and it's more difficult to talk to them so I went for lunch yesterday with the head of AI tribe here at a grocery delivery service in largest one in Czech Republic and they was asking me things you know what frameworks do you use how how do you go about this and I'll just tell them you know there's no express and I build the service just like I would any other back end service and it becomes full stack and I'm using a mono repo what's a mono repo you asked me you know have you heard of turbo repawn no what's that and I quickly understood that you know the guys that been in put in charge of these initiatives they haven't done the trial by fire lucky in so much and you know for me I don't see OK Yeah they're ambitious everyone has ambitious is fantastic and I'm sure everyone's ambitious to them are huge but I'm delivering automations for agencies and for me it's easy it's the easy II see it like the matrix now you know it's patterns and there's always the same patterns that you do I guess over time when you build a software everything's just the same rehash of a pattern of a pattern and we have some different tooling on top to make those patterns more abstract but yeah digressing so this and this whole back and forth at lunch just made me realise well I should be doing more definitely and I need to find those types of people because I do have a huge wealth of experience that others don't like in sidestep so many issues So let's talk a little bit about you know how I see the proper way to do LLM applied work for a business games it's not a hydraulic the this grocery delivery stuff doing where they're hiring Python developers to build scripts that do LOM cools and then they do some front end with some force that python definitely what the world is built on Javascript interactions are built on Java script and now we've got my divide code in and the everyone else is building Javascript is only going to get bigger and yeah it's all consuming so look next section let's talk about how you should see the back and forth between the macro and the micro level and what should drive your goals for LLM applied LLM sorry set up although we'll fly LLM setups the goal is ultimately the same whether you're coming from the top down from the the bottom up is whether this is a directive from the CEO who wants to see more gains because he wants to see speed and cost efficiency and they understand that you have a few carved three months off a 12 month market expansion plan because you can go extremely fast and then you realise that revenue three months faster and that's a huge pocket of change but for me when I've got the consultant hat on I'm able to sell this stream it's a great way to go in but it does go fat odds with the guys that are coming from the top the bottom up approach or the hard thinking about this in macro so again an example they were saying that they're leading with marketing because their automation because they need to do things like generate an email so or you know the email content they need other stuff they're essentially looking at where the time is spent and treating isn't overhead reduction exercise but I'm actually guilty of this too definitely on that for the longest time I sold it as a overhead reduction cost in AA sorry allowance stuff definitely because there's this this notion of AI agents at the moment and then the marketing spiel sale spiel is AI agents are going to move or replace this human right so obviously what's the biggest human cost while it's it's overheads so yeah anyway through this the macro right great place to start for sales as a consultant always lead back to everything you do to macro at the end of the day you're running a business and your business takes some input does something with it creates an output then that goes into the capsules machine and I get you the cash that gets you what you want and the main benefit of automation and apply the LLM is to see speed and cost efficiencies that allow you to do more work faster and bypass the longer processes and realise revenue quicker so your KPI should probably be something like time to revenue and revenue ratio whatever that might be now we also have this idea that that this is great but we still need to build something so what do we build we've got the goals right we've got the Kpis and the macro level from the from the top down is is perfect and it shouldn't be about saving overheads though that is one part of cost efficiency we also have the we can't just switch off employees you know it's not like we're just going to go on to V2 of an AP and all the employees magically scale up it's not how it works there also needs to be a bottom up approach where you need to give the tools to your current existing employers so that they can augment their current workflows we just want to chat gpt and tools like this clauders of fantastic because you're you're just you have access to a faster way of doing things now off topic i'm not sure if the passing of the cognitive load to an LLM is great for you in the long run definitely you should I'm finding it now that maybe there is some convicted decline but not having to think about things like as I'm writing this now I'm feeling infinitely more involved in the challenge where as I know that someone else won't just go right give me a blog post XIZ so I'm back back on topic right we need this bottom up approach so if you have someone in marketing or sales and they say ah **** you know what I need a quick three part email welcome series letter they should be able to generate that as long as it's new the cheques and balances of that to make sure that it's on brand and it's not **** and it's not just that I've got lazy work but they also need to integrate with your your wider business right so let's talk about groceries thousands and thousands of products excuse you need to be able to say hey I want to fight into the top sellers in alcohol and then when it's a bank holiday or some public event make sure that we have an email campaign that's set up for this this showing our top salads and our promoted deals that we have with with on email tenancy partners this is something that we don't need to build a full on system to say no that the human now doesn't do this the human you know like here's a python script that does it for you so don't bother what we need is a set of Lego blocks a set of tools a set of modular functions that we can stitch together at different levels so that people can all do the work in an automated fashion so you've got people that will just like you know level one and it's going to be people using Nator for make.com or some sort of drag and drop or you know if whatever sequences I even buy in software and go through sequences saas style essays AAS and it makes their work easier and faster and it empowers them to do something and they might be using proprietary data from you know product feed that you have but if they have an issue then they should be empowered by automation by applied LLM then let's go hand in hand now to do the work then you have level 2 where you're like OK this works is greater the ad hoc tasks are being done by level 1 level 2 is more like let's be systematic about what we're actually trying to automate and achieve here and this is when the macro and the micro join together slightly because you're coming up with projects with fixed goals to say right OK i'll our time to market on a new site for a new territory is currently six months what are the levers that we can pull to bring it out to 2 1/2 things like translation or feed collection or supplier management or hiring of drivers and logistics and you know all of this stuff still make a very business specific things but it will take up time and we'll have to happen at once how do we make those faster so overall we cut that time down so this is the level two you have established systems maybe some they're like interdepartmental and they're they're run by like an overseeing AI team that's that's charged with integrating all of these different things but it still lives at team level right it's lots of different team level automations that come together to make things faster and make things more cost efficient but you're now realising the revenue implications that's level 2 level 3 at the top is like way more abstract because we're not there yet I don't think but can touch on it is that this is when you you look just remove parts of your business that were let's call it legacy built legacy built built in a time where we only had access to human resources now we have access to human resources plus LM resource and whatever else in the future and for the most part a lot of these issues go away that we had previously so you know if you're dealing with logistics of how to get your delivery from warehouse A to customer B on the traditionally with ignorant OK so I need a driver and I need to take it there and then you know maybe there's some optimization at the root but level 3 isn't is about okay how do we use applied LLMS and automation to say that we even need the driver or do we even need the customer do we even need the warehouse and these are the skunk works projects that are and D projects these are much longer loftier problem solving things there require the people like me whose have done this for their own businesses and continues to do so and loves it but you also need to you know there can be a disconnect but between the micro of what's doing and the macro level 3 because all in all it all adds to efficiencies around but I think there's this is the way that I won't go about things I don't think that um just a top down approach should work I don't think we just automation in one team is going to work and let's let's talk us about that section and that quickly so how do you how do you handle like you know there's there's a new tool for everyone that we can use it happens very rarely thank you really Google Docs was probably you know the collaborative file share probably the last time I can think of one that was really really great maybe a slack I don't know I used to play on Teamspeak and ventrilo a so like 20 years so remote collaborative experiences nothing new but for the workforce yeah definitely this were refining moments for me. Now we have teams that all want to use the same tools the same flavours of tools some of them the sales guys the moment they or the outreach guys really want to use clay dot com they really still using clay using Apollo they're using smart league they use them instantly all of these outreach I guess smartleads.Ai not Smart League and they are for the most part using wildly different tools than your traditional marketing automation guy unless I marketing automation a lot of people think oh yeah that's like email welcome series yeah we can do that with mailchimp or you know Hubspot or for the PPC guys it's going to be yeah yeah so I can create a product feed and we'll send that to ecommerce store or build at of the back of that is now product catalogue for Facebook and then you've got okay what we got there we're still generating content and we still using the same proprietary business data or 3rd party data we're just doing things a different way. A more abstract way so we we at a level of abstraction into our workflows because he's applied LLM talks like chat GPT like Claude like cursor like whatever you're ended up buying for all of the GPT wrappers they're there they add stuff away and eventually someone will look at this and say Hey we have massive software sprawl we need to cut down the amount of tools that we use because training is insane and nothing makes sense and I need to handle 50 different licence types and you let some products will do great on some things and others fail at it and they will look to standardise this so ai and applied element doesn't live in a bubble you need to stand it out at some point I believe just like all tools for software engineers you'll know that you're not going to have code across many different git types for the most part you choose one ecosystem and you live on that ecosystem for better or for worse yeah for marketing for example like what's your marketing website built in it's not like three different flavours of cmss is it but for the most part they're over here maybe you should think about consolidation but anyway what I'm what I'm trying to get to the point of here is that you don't have the luxury of using a million different tools forever because this where you're just trying to automate and you're trying to find the speed and cost efficiencies you actually end up being less efficient because everyone is so siloed and not together and it takes more time for this cost more it's more expensive to maintain all these systems because you need an expert in each of them or you over rely on 11 guy or one team to do a little and then this is like a huge issue that I saw when I had my lunch yesterday with the guy working on the AI teams is that he's just hiring python developers to throw them at tasks and that's a great way of getting spaghetti dept no no one wants that it works really well to start and you do have to go through that journey but you need the top down approach in the bottom up approach because you can't just democratise everyone's workflow does that make sense?\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"So I guess I'm trying to say that the right approach to applied LLMS in automation and to receive these speed and cost optimizations to win yeah with automation is you need a three tiered approach definitely start by empowering everyone to use these tools if there's pushback people say no I don't like them then you've got to think about what why don't they like is it because they're not ready to train is it because the tours that you're giving aren't good for them is it you know do you understand their role they should be good they should be very grassroots right and you should incentivize the the the efficiency gains the time to revenue the time to feature the time to X gains here and if someone shows initiative you should lead with that and encourage them more and the level two here you do need whilst you have this this lead inside a team that meant several teams you need to make sure that they have shared with everyone else in the company in your group or in your whatever sharing what tools work for them we talk about you know not just like are these these tools are great I love these tools you don't want to have lots of different tribes with their favourite setups something like yes you can but at some point you're going to want to standardise some of the stuff I would say like hey yes we use n8n here is a massive library that interacts with that product database and with everything and here are endpoints so that if you want to you know use n8n with our community nodes or our data then you can do and like fantastic that's level 2 yeah and maybe we're we'll we'll bring in some of the engineers to look at how they can do other things there as well it's great but then these this team this interdepartmental team that leads those initiatives they also need to be governed by a wider top down approach which is what the **** are we actually doing why are we doing the LLMS why why are we acting like this as a business and the question that I would ask is if your business was built today from scratch with all of the tools available to you what would it look like and what would it look like differently and this is a question that's very hard for some people because it's hard to box thinking question and this is this type of problems that I like to solve but I started by solving them for agencies because I know what it's like to to work in an agency to you know there's a lot of **** in there and there's a lot of inefficiency but it really it starts with like a top down top down goals bottom up grassroots automation and then in the middle you do need to force some sort of innovation some teams have an innovation lead others might be looking at applied LLM directors chief of LLMS Chief of automation is probably the role that I would go for but yeah just just have a think about this this is not a new problem to solve this has existed in so many different forms in web cooling and scraping in robotic process automation it's you know just a new a new team has been set up because we're now Main Street right applied LLM is Main Street whether you like it or not but it's the same flavour as the last 10 years new software comes out and we adapt and change just this one is has more potential and because we're realising games literally everywhere it's very easy to pigeonhole when you should be thinking huge levels so my takeaways from this are have someone that gives a **** about operations in your business and the automations of those operations the ceo for example is a great place to start and if they're not technical get them a right hand man that's technical i'll let it understand system can speak automation don't leave it to engineers because engineers are in a bubble they'd be great to build in but they need to you know in ultimately you need to you need to workers that are doing the work to lead the automation because they know how they're doing it and they understand the work and the inefficiencies and you need to be able to say firstly about 1 do we need to do this is this even a task that needs doing why we doing it what's the benefits to the business for doing this task too okay how do we get rid of the task and replace it with something more streamlined 3 like how do we just give you the tools needed so that you can go and do this another take away would be use a build some internal library some packages let's do software engineers you know always use some packages right would it not be great to be able to pmpm instal your business packages and use them across everything so sales and marketing have their own setups and they have a wider block of Lego books let's talk about when we do this if this article write down notebook like Lego box it's a key theme I want it to be which is like you can have some Lego that sits very specific pieces that are going to help the marketing team build just their marketing stuff very specific pieces that are going to help the sales team to scrape leagues you're still going to be Lego blocks and they're still going to be usable by everyone if they want to then you're going to have your basic blocks which you know you need some imagination to use but they're there and they took great with your business logic with your business data with your tools and your stuff and you need people to put the instructions to know what they're building you need the people with the imagination and the vision and to know that they've got taste and clarity and you know to build something beautiful there's also functional and can maybe you know not not just like a Lego statue but it's like this it's a leaving a living breathing organism or system and this is really like important to me so these are just my thoughts on the last couple days on where I see what I'm doing and the cta for this should be that I am ready to take up the reins to help companies ambitious companies across all of these aspects this is my goal this is what I'm passionate about this is what I've been doing for the last 10 years and I'm very happy to see all of the results that have all of the gains especially around the Pioneer LMS because I think it's fantastic it's bringing more people into an engineer's mindset it's it's it's making more people more productive it's helping everything to become more potentially faster more efficient more cost efficient speed efficient but also you have the opportunity to **** things up definitely make it more convoluted you need someone like me to pull this

</h3><p>All right we're going to write some article notes here so I'm just going to dictate to you and then at the end of it think of this story pattern that we should be telling for the article and write down the different sections so that I can flesh out later so I'm writing about a small workshop that I'm running one on one with job seekers called CV surgery; I'm a part of the cv surgery i'm basically teaching job searches job seekers that you have to go to the bottom up approach and just apply to all the jobs yeah it could work you might get there but there's never been more job applications out there you never faced more competition and you never you never had such a low chances of getting the work especially in specific fields that being disrupted right now like in software engineering so I'm showing them the the top down approach I'm showing them the sales development rep outreach approach you know find your list of potential customers use your cv use your keywords use your thoughts work out your hit list of companies that you want to apply for find out signals like what's the headcount growth in the last 6 month such and such a department and then how do we reach out to those guys so that it looks like you really give a **** and your bypass in all of this hellscape I don't know if you've ever applied or sorry I don't know if you've ever posted a job on linkedin or indeed but wow it is not fun at all you're completely quickly quickly overwhelmed with the amount of **** that you're being given and now it's all AI generated **** different flavours of the same looking words and it's really disheartening and it means that if you are a standout candidate you could quite well be buried and if you're a standout candidate that's trying to use applied LLM techniques because you think you'll help you do better and everyone's thinking that and everyone's sounding very similar so they're top down approach with CV surgery so I mislead the title it should be I mean the title of it should be more like hey stop doing job search the way that you're being taught how to do it for the last forever instead act like a sales rep and do it from the top down so anyway this these 1 to 1 sessions at 20 minutes I show a little tool that they put a cv into we get an Apollo list it's very cool it's very fun and they leave the call feeling empowered to go do the job search in a way that's they feel in control instead of just hope and fingers that they put the application in and someone sees it no I did a demo of this and 1 of it was to someone the CFO who was working sorry I was doing a demo and one of the leads that came up was to CFO of a grocery delivery store here in Prague for one of the biggest or the biggest in the country and they got back to me within 10 minutes and saying hey maybe you want to talk to our ai guys about a job sorry it was a great demo for me but then I actually went and I spoke to them and here's what went down. so my background is software development especially in automation and LLM applied LLM stuff right now it's also you know I've been an agency on it well a freelancer turned agency on potentially for nearly 15 years I think I'm not sure probably longer between full-time jobs and I know that the last year also has been the most difficult time ever i've never struggled to find work with the opportunities out there right now I never seemed farther away it's it's quite crazy really so it's always been on me to find the work and the pattern that I've seen always is that as soon as you put yourself out there and you actively go looking for it you won't find the work and this is saved my so many times and continues to do so and when I really need to find the work it's out there you just have to put yourself in the right position with the right tools and artillery and ammo to get the job done so the case studies you have something to be very passionate about talking about when you speak to someone do they do they get it and you know I've done a lot of this but a YouTube channel with a couple years of content now and my dear hub is my gift profile it's absolutely insane loads of work still coding every single day most days I really enjoy it too and I'm working on problems that most people aren't you know the automation space the LLM space sorry I applied LOL space there's a fantastic for me the last time that I did this for the first time I did this so I was not 10 years ago I had a voucher published in some called voucher nought like astronaut but voucher nought and my whole stick there was that I wanted to automate as much as possible using javascript so that was things like building boss that would interact with the Fiat network sites pull out new deals and new offers apply to them covering letters when I get hold of them follow up by email et cetera like this one sounds very trivial now that we know what we can do with a genetic tool flows and we have tools like any tenant make dot com can just code this but 10 years ago you had to build in all of these goods you have to write all of this yourself with your own custom logic and you had to really back and rely on these flaky systems and for the most part it worked so you know II would wake up in the morning and be like wow I didn't even know this brand existed with that paying me for affiliate that's fantastic it's me as a team ended up to me very well we sold that business class actually partner bought it and then we we sold it again so I made some great cash there but yeah so I've always learned how stressful it's been to make money find money and position yourself as an expert and now I'm seeing this new wave of expert who didn't come up through doing the hard stuff like I did and they're doing everything on easy mode and relying on the prompting and outputs and yeah it's still good right it's great i'm just very happy that it's this thing we could for the longest time it was my hill to die open as it is fantastic really absolutely fantastic been able to just recreate fire from fire that you've created something it's insane but um right now I'm dealing with people that haven't gone through the motions of automated the business multiple times they haven't done this for other people and it's more difficult to talk to them so I went for lunch yesterday with the head of AI tribe here at a grocery delivery service in largest one in Czech Republic and they was asking me things you know what frameworks do you use how how do you go about this and I'll just tell them you know there's no express and I build the service just like I would any other back end service and it becomes full stack and I'm using a mono repo what's a mono repo you asked me you know have you heard of turbo repawn no what's that and I quickly understood that you know the guys that been in put in charge of these initiatives they haven't done the trial by fire lucky in so much and you know for me I don't see OK Yeah they're ambitious everyone has ambitious is fantastic and I'm sure everyone's ambitious to them are huge but I'm delivering automations for agencies and for me it's easy it's the easy II see it like the matrix now you know it's patterns and there's always the same patterns that you do I guess over time when you build a software everything's just the same rehash of a pattern of a pattern and we have some different tooling on top to make those patterns more abstract but yeah digressing so this and this whole back and forth at lunch just made me realise well I should be doing more definitely and I need to find those types of people because I do have a huge wealth of experience that others don't like in sidestep so many issues So let's talk a little bit about you know how I see the proper way to do LLM applied work for a business games it's not a hydraulic the this grocery delivery stuff doing where they're hiring Python developers to build scripts that do LOM cools and then they do some front end with some force that python definitely what the world is built on Javascript interactions are built on Java script and now we've got my divide code in and the everyone else is building Javascript is only going to get bigger and yeah it's all consuming so look next section let's talk about how you should see the back and forth between the macro and the micro level and what should drive your goals for LLM applied LLM sorry set up although we'll fly LLM setups the goal is ultimately the same whether you're coming from the top down from the the bottom up is whether this is a directive from the CEO who wants to see more gains because he wants to see speed and cost efficiency and they understand that you have a few carved three months off a 12 month market expansion plan because you can go extremely fast and then you realise that revenue three months faster and that's a huge pocket of change but for me when I've got the consultant hat on I'm able to sell this stream it's a great way to go in but it does go fat odds with the guys that are coming from the top the bottom up approach or the hard thinking about this in macro so again an example they were saying that they're leading with marketing because their automation because they need to do things like generate an email so or you know the email content they need other stuff they're essentially looking at where the time is spent and treating isn't overhead reduction exercise but I'm actually guilty of this too definitely on that for the longest time I sold it as a overhead reduction cost in AA sorry allowance stuff definitely because there's this this notion of AI agents at the moment and then the marketing spiel sale spiel is AI agents are going to move or replace this human right so obviously what's the biggest human cost while it's it's overheads so yeah anyway through this the macro right great place to start for sales as a consultant always lead back to everything you do to macro at the end of the day you're running a business and your business takes some input does something with it creates an output then that goes into the capsules machine and I get you the cash that gets you what you want and the main benefit of automation and apply the LLM is to see speed and cost efficiencies that allow you to do more work faster and bypass the longer processes and realise revenue quicker so your KPI should probably be something like time to revenue and revenue ratio whatever that might be now we also have this idea that that this is great but we still need to build something so what do we build we've got the goals right we've got the Kpis and the macro level from the from the top down is is perfect and it shouldn't be about saving overheads though that is one part of cost efficiency we also have the we can't just switch off employees you know it's not like we're just going to go on to V2 of an AP and all the employees magically scale up it's not how it works there also needs to be a bottom up approach where you need to give the tools to your current existing employers so that they can augment their current workflows we just want to chat gpt and tools like this clauders of fantastic because you're you're just you have access to a faster way of doing things now off topic i'm not sure if the passing of the cognitive load to an LLM is great for you in the long run definitely you should I'm finding it now that maybe there is some convicted decline but not having to think about things like as I'm writing this now I'm feeling infinitely more involved in the challenge where as I know that someone else won't just go right give me a blog post XIZ so I'm back back on topic right we need this bottom up approach so if you have someone in marketing or sales and they say ah **** you know what I need a quick three part email welcome series letter they should be able to generate that as long as it's new the cheques and balances of that to make sure that it's on brand and it's not **** and it's not just that I've got lazy work but they also need to integrate with your your wider business right so let's talk about groceries thousands and thousands of products excuse you need to be able to say hey I want to fight into the top sellers in alcohol and then when it's a bank holiday or some public event make sure that we have an email campaign that's set up for this this showing our top salads and our promoted deals that we have with with on email tenancy partners this is something that we don't need to build a full on system to say no that the human now doesn't do this the human you know like here's a python script that does it for you so don't bother what we need is a set of Lego blocks a set of tools a set of modular functions that we can stitch together at different levels so that people can all do the work in an automated fashion so you've got people that will just like you know level one and it's going to be people using Nator for make.com or some sort of drag and drop or you know if whatever sequences I even buy in software and go through sequences saas style essays AAS and it makes their work easier and faster and it empowers them to do something and they might be using proprietary data from you know product feed that you have but if they have an issue then they should be empowered by automation by applied LLM then let's go hand in hand now to do the work then you have level 2 where you're like OK this works is greater the ad hoc tasks are being done by level 1 level 2 is more like let's be systematic about what we're actually trying to automate and achieve here and this is when the macro and the micro join together slightly because you're coming up with projects with fixed goals to say right OK i'll our time to market on a new site for a new territory is currently six months what are the levers that we can pull to bring it out to 2 1/2 things like translation or feed collection or supplier management or hiring of drivers and logistics and you know all of this stuff still make a very business specific things but it will take up time and we'll have to happen at once how do we make those faster so overall we cut that time down so this is the level two you have established systems maybe some they're like interdepartmental and they're they're run by like an overseeing AI team that's that's charged with integrating all of these different things but it still lives at team level right it's lots of different team level automations that come together to make things faster and make things more cost efficient but you're now realising the revenue implications that's level 2 level 3 at the top is like way more abstract because we're not there yet I don't think but can touch on it is that this is when you you look just remove parts of your business that were let's call it legacy built legacy built built in a time where we only had access to human resources now we have access to human resources plus LM resource and whatever else in the future and for the most part a lot of these issues go away that we had previously so you know if you're dealing with logistics of how to get your delivery from warehouse A to customer B on the traditionally with ignorant OK so I need a driver and I need to take it there and then you know maybe there's some optimization at the root but level 3 isn't is about okay how do we use applied LLMS and automation to say that we even need the driver or do we even need the customer do we even need the warehouse and these are the skunk works projects that are and D projects these are much longer loftier problem solving things there require the people like me whose have done this for their own businesses and continues to do so and loves it but you also need to you know there can be a disconnect but between the micro of what's doing and the macro level 3 because all in all it all adds to efficiencies around but I think there's this is the way that I won't go about things I don't think that um just a top down approach should work I don't think we just automation in one team is going to work and let's let's talk us about that section and that quickly so how do you how do you handle like you know there's there's a new tool for everyone that we can use it happens very rarely thank you really Google Docs was probably you know the collaborative file share probably the last time I can think of one that was really really great maybe a slack I don't know I used to play on Teamspeak and ventrilo a so like 20 years so remote collaborative experiences nothing new but for the workforce yeah definitely this were refining moments for me. Now we have teams that all want to use the same tools the same flavours of tools some of them the sales guys the moment they or the outreach guys really want to use clay dot com they really still using clay using Apollo they're using smart league they use them instantly all of these outreach I guess smartleads.Ai not Smart League and they are for the most part using wildly different tools than your traditional marketing automation guy unless I marketing automation a lot of people think oh yeah that's like email welcome series yeah we can do that with mailchimp or you know Hubspot or for the PPC guys it's going to be yeah yeah so I can create a product feed and we'll send that to ecommerce store or build at of the back of that is now product catalogue for Facebook and then you've got okay what we got there we're still generating content and we still using the same proprietary business data or 3rd party data we're just doing things a different way. A more abstract way so we we at a level of abstraction into our workflows because he's applied LLM talks like chat GPT like Claude like cursor like whatever you're ended up buying for all of the GPT wrappers they're there they add stuff away and eventually someone will look at this and say Hey we have massive software sprawl we need to cut down the amount of tools that we use because training is insane and nothing makes sense and I need to handle 50 different licence types and you let some products will do great on some things and others fail at it and they will look to standardise this so ai and applied element doesn't live in a bubble you need to stand it out at some point I believe just like all tools for software engineers you'll know that you're not going to have code across many different git types for the most part you choose one ecosystem and you live on that ecosystem for better or for worse yeah for marketing for example like what's your marketing website built in it's not like three different flavours of cmss is it but for the most part they're over here maybe you should think about consolidation but anyway what I'm what I'm trying to get to the point of here is that you don't have the luxury of using a million different tools forever because this where you're just trying to automate and you're trying to find the speed and cost efficiencies you actually end up being less efficient because everyone is so siloed and not together and it takes more time for this cost more it's more expensive to maintain all these systems because you need an expert in each of them or you over rely on 11 guy or one team to do a little and then this is like a huge issue that I saw when I had my lunch yesterday with the guy working on the AI teams is that he's just hiring python developers to throw them at tasks and that's a great way of getting spaghetti dept no no one wants that it works really well to start and you do have to go through that journey but you need the top down approach in the bottom up approach because you can't just democratise everyone's workflow does that make sense?</p><p></p><p>So I guess I'm trying to say that the right approach to applied LLMS in automation and to receive these speed and cost optimizations to win yeah with automation is you need a three tiered approach definitely start by empowering everyone to use these tools if there's pushback people say no I don't like them then you've got to think about what why don't they like is it because they're not ready to train is it because the tours that you're giving aren't good for them is it you know do you understand their role they should be good they should be very grassroots right and you should incentivize the the the efficiency gains the time to revenue the time to feature the time to X gains here and if someone shows initiative you should lead with that and encourage them more and the level two here you do need whilst you have this this lead inside a team that meant several teams you need to make sure that they have shared with everyone else in the company in your group or in your whatever sharing what tools work for them we talk about you know not just like are these these tools are great I love these tools you don't want to have lots of different tribes with their favourite setups something like yes you can but at some point you're going to want to standardise some of the stuff I would say like hey yes we use n8n here is a massive library that interacts with that product database and with everything and here are endpoints so that if you want to you know use n8n with our community nodes or our data then you can do and like fantastic that's level 2 yeah and maybe we're we'll we'll bring in some of the engineers to look at how they can do other things there as well it's great but then these this team this interdepartmental team that leads those initiatives they also need to be governed by a wider top down approach which is what the **** are we actually doing why are we doing the LLMS why why are we acting like this as a business and the question that I would ask is if your business was built today from scratch with all of the tools available to you what would it look like and what would it look like differently and this is a question that's very hard for some people because it's hard to box thinking question and this is this type of problems that I like to solve but I started by solving them for agencies because I know what it's like to to work in an agency to you know there's a lot of **** in there and there's a lot of inefficiency but it really it starts with like a top down top down goals bottom up grassroots automation and then in the middle you do need to force some sort of innovation some teams have an innovation lead others might be looking at applied LLM directors chief of LLMS Chief of automation is probably the role that I would go for but yeah just just have a think about this this is not a new problem to solve this has existed in so many different forms in web cooling and scraping in robotic process automation it's you know just a new a new team has been set up because we're now Main Street right applied LLM is Main Street whether you like it or not but it's the same flavour as the last 10 years new software comes out and we adapt and change just this one is has more potential and because we're realising games literally everywhere it's very easy to pigeonhole when you should be thinking huge levels so my takeaways from this are have someone that gives a **** about operations in your business and the automations of those operations the ceo for example is a great place to start and if they're not technical get them a right hand man that's technical i'll let it understand system can speak automation don't leave it to engineers because engineers are in a bubble they'd be great to build in but they need to you know in ultimately you need to you need to workers that are doing the work to lead the automation because they know how they're doing it and they understand the work and the inefficiencies and you need to be able to say firstly about 1 do we need to do this is this even a task that needs doing why we doing it what's the benefits to the business for doing this task too okay how do we get rid of the task and replace it with something more streamlined 3 like how do we just give you the tools needed so that you can go and do this another take away would be use a build some internal library some packages let's do software engineers you know always use some packages right would it not be great to be able to pmpm instal your business packages and use them across everything so sales and marketing have their own setups and they have a wider block of Lego books let's talk about when we do this if this article write down notebook like Lego box it's a key theme I want it to be which is like you can have some Lego that sits very specific pieces that are going to help the marketing team build just their marketing stuff very specific pieces that are going to help the sales team to scrape leagues you're still going to be Lego blocks and they're still going to be usable by everyone if they want to then you're going to have your basic blocks which you know you need some imagination to use but they're there and they took great with your business logic with your business data with your tools and your stuff and you need people to put the instructions to know what they're building you need the people with the imagination and the vision and to know that they've got taste and clarity and you know to build something beautiful there's also functional and can maybe you know not not just like a Lego statue but it's like this it's a leaving a living breathing organism or system and this is really like important to me so these are just my thoughts on the last couple days on where I see what I'm doing and the cta for this should be that I am ready to take up the reins to help companies ambitious companies across all of these aspects this is my goal this is what I'm passionate about this is what I've been doing for the last 10 years and I'm very happy to see all of the results that have all of the gains especially around the Pioneer LMS because I think it's fantastic it's bringing more people into an engineer's mindset it's it's it's making more people more productive it's helping everything to become more potentially faster more efficient more cost efficient speed efficient but also you have the opportunity to **** things up definitely make it more convoluted you need someone like me to pull this in<br></p><hr><h3 id=\"assistant\">Assistant: </h3><p>The text appears to be a dictated stream of consciousness about the

Turning chaotic, disjointed rants into deep work. PS. Here's the finished article: Steal This Blueprint: Making Money with LLMs—At Scale\n\n\nMe:\n\nAll right we're going to write some article notes here so I'm just going to dictate to you and then at the end of it think of this story pattern that we should be telling for the article and write down the different sections so that I can flesh out later so I'm writing about a small workshop that I'm running one on one with job seekers called CV surgery; I'm a part of the cv surgery i'm basically teaching job searches job seekers that you have to go to the bottom up approach and just apply to all the jobs yeah it could work you might get there but there's never been more job applications out there you never faced more competition and you never you never had such a low chances of getting the work especially in specific fields that being disrupted right now like in software engineering so I'm showing them the the top down approach I'm showing them the sales development rep outreach approach you know find your list of potential customers use your cv use your keywords use your thoughts work out your hit list of companies that you want to apply for find out signals like what's the headcount growth in the last 6 month such and such a department and then how do we reach out to those guys so that it looks like you really give a **** and your bypass in all of this hellscape I don't know if you've ever applied or sorry I don't know if you've ever posted a job on linkedin or indeed but wow it is not fun at all you're completely quickly quickly overwhelmed with the amount of **** that you're being given and now it's all AI generated **** different flavours of the same looking words and it's really disheartening and it means that if you are a standout candidate you could quite well be buried and if you're a standout candidate that's trying to use applied LLM techniques because you think you'll help you do better and everyone's thinking that and everyone's sounding very similar so they're top down approach with CV surgery so I mislead the title it should be I mean the title of it should be more like hey stop doing job search the way that you're being taught how to do it for the last forever instead act like a sales rep and do it from the top down so anyway this these 1 to 1 sessions at 20 minutes I show a little tool that they put a cv into we get an Apollo list it's very cool it's very fun and they leave the call feeling empowered to go do the job search in a way that's they feel in control instead of just hope and fingers that they put the application in and someone sees it no I did a demo of this and 1 of it was to someone the CFO who was working sorry I was doing a demo and one of the leads that came up was to CFO of a grocery delivery store here in Prague for one of the biggest or the biggest in the country and they got back to me within 10 minutes and saying hey maybe you want to talk to our ai guys about a job sorry it was a great demo for me but then I actually went and I spoke to them and here's what went down. so my background is software development especially in automation and LLM applied LLM stuff right now it's also you know I've been an agency on it well a freelancer turned agency on potentially for nearly 15 years I think I'm not sure probably longer between full-time jobs and I know that the last year also has been the most difficult time ever i've never struggled to find work with the opportunities out there right now I never seemed farther away it's it's quite crazy really so it's always been on me to find the work and the pattern that I've seen always is that as soon as you put yourself out there and you actively go looking for it you won't find the work and this is saved my so many times and continues to do so and when I really need to find the work it's out there you just have to put yourself in the right position with the right tools and artillery and ammo to get the job done so the case studies you have something to be very passionate about talking about when you speak to someone do they do they get it and you know I've done a lot of this but a YouTube channel with a couple years of content now and my dear hub is my gift profile it's absolutely insane loads of work still coding every single day most days I really enjoy it too and I'm working on problems that most people aren't you know the automation space the LLM space sorry I applied LOL space there's a fantastic for me the last time that I did this for the first time I did this so I was not 10 years ago I had a voucher published in some called voucher nought like astronaut but voucher nought and my whole stick there was that I wanted to automate as much as possible using javascript so that was things like building boss that would interact with the Fiat network sites pull out new deals and new offers apply to them covering letters when I get hold of them follow up by email et cetera like this one sounds very trivial now that we know what we can do with a genetic tool flows and we have tools like any tenant make dot com can just code this but 10 years ago you had to build in all of these goods you have to write all of this yourself with your own custom logic and you had to really back and rely on these flaky systems and for the most part it worked so you know II would wake up in the morning and be like wow I didn't even know this brand existed with that paying me for affiliate that's fantastic it's me as a team ended up to me very well we sold that business class actually partner bought it and then we we sold it again so I made some great cash there but yeah so I've always learned how stressful it's been to make money find money and position yourself as an expert and now I'm seeing this new wave of expert who didn't come up through doing the hard stuff like I did and they're doing everything on easy mode and relying on the prompting and outputs and yeah it's still good right it's great i'm just very happy that it's this thing we could for the longest time it was my hill to die open as it is fantastic really absolutely fantastic been able to just recreate fire from fire that you've created something it's insane but um right now I'm dealing with people that haven't gone through the motions of automated the business multiple times they haven't done this for other people and it's more difficult to talk to them so I went for lunch yesterday with the head of AI tribe here at a grocery delivery service in largest one in Czech Republic and they was asking me things you know what frameworks do you use how how do you go about this and I'll just tell them you know there's no express and I build the service just like I would any other back end service and it becomes full stack and I'm using a mono repo what's a mono repo you asked me you know have you heard of turbo repawn no what's that and I quickly understood that you know the guys that been in put in charge of these initiatives they haven't done the trial by fire lucky in so much and you know for me I don't see OK Yeah they're ambitious everyone has ambitious is fantastic and I'm sure everyone's ambitious to them are huge but I'm delivering automations for agencies and for me it's easy it's the easy II see it like the matrix now you know it's patterns and there's always the same patterns that you do I guess over time when you build a software everything's just the same rehash of a pattern of a pattern and we have some different tooling on top to make those patterns more abstract but yeah digressing so this and this whole back and forth at lunch just made me realise well I should be doing more definitely and I need to find those types of people because I do have a huge wealth of experience that others don't like in sidestep so many issues So let's talk a little bit about you know how I see the proper way to do LLM applied work for a business games it's not a hydraulic the this grocery delivery stuff doing where they're hiring Python developers to build scripts that do LOM cools and then they do some front end with some force that python definitely what the world is built on Javascript interactions are built on Java script and now we've got my divide code in and the everyone else is building Javascript is only going to get bigger and yeah it's all consuming so look next section let's talk about how you should see the back and forth between the macro and the micro level and what should drive your goals for LLM applied LLM sorry set up although we'll fly LLM setups the goal is ultimately the same whether you're coming from the top down from the the bottom up is whether this is a directive from the CEO who wants to see more gains because he wants to see speed and cost efficiency and they understand that you have a few carved three months off a 12 month market expansion plan because you can go extremely fast and then you realise that revenue three months faster and that's a huge pocket of change but for me when I've got the consultant hat on I'm able to sell this stream it's a great way to go in but it does go fat odds with the guys that are coming from the top the bottom up approach or the hard thinking about this in macro so again an example they were saying that they're leading with marketing because their automation because they need to do things like generate an email so or you know the email content they need other stuff they're essentially looking at where the time is spent and treating isn't overhead reduction exercise but I'm actually guilty of this too definitely on that for the longest time I sold it as a overhead reduction cost in AA sorry allowance stuff definitely because there's this this notion of AI agents at the moment and then the marketing spiel sale spiel is AI agents are going to move or replace this human right so obviously what's the biggest human cost while it's it's overheads so yeah anyway through this the macro right great place to start for sales as a consultant always lead back to everything you do to macro at the end of the day you're running a business and your business takes some input does something with it creates an output then that goes into the capsules machine and I get you the cash that gets you what you want and the main benefit of automation and apply the LLM is to see speed and cost efficiencies that allow you to do more work faster and bypass the longer processes and realise revenue quicker so your KPI should probably be something like time to revenue and revenue ratio whatever that might be now we also have this idea that that this is great but we still need to build something so what do we build we've got the goals right we've got the Kpis and the macro level from the from the top down is is perfect and it shouldn't be about saving overheads though that is one part of cost efficiency we also have the we can't just switch off employees you know it's not like we're just going to go on to V2 of an AP and all the employees magically scale up it's not how it works there also needs to be a bottom up approach where you need to give the tools to your current existing employers so that they can augment their current workflows we just want to chat gpt and tools like this clauders of fantastic because you're you're just you have access to a faster way of doing things now off topic i'm not sure if the passing of the cognitive load to an LLM is great for you in the long run definitely you should I'm finding it now that maybe there is some convicted decline but not having to think about things like as I'm writing this now I'm feeling infinitely more involved in the challenge where as I know that someone else won't just go right give me a blog post XIZ so I'm back back on topic right we need this bottom up approach so if you have someone in marketing or sales and they say ah **** you know what I need a quick three part email welcome series letter they should be able to generate that as long as it's new the cheques and balances of that to make sure that it's on brand and it's not **** and it's not just that I've got lazy work but they also need to integrate with your your wider business right so let's talk about groceries thousands and thousands of products excuse you need to be able to say hey I want to fight into the top sellers in alcohol and then when it's a bank holiday or some public event make sure that we have an email campaign that's set up for this this showing our top salads and our promoted deals that we have with with on email tenancy partners this is something that we don't need to build a full on system to say no that the human now doesn't do this the human you know like here's a python script that does it for you so don't bother what we need is a set of Lego blocks a set of tools a set of modular functions that we can stitch together at different levels so that people can all do the work in an automated fashion so you've got people that will just like you know level one and it's going to be people using Nator for make.com or some sort of drag and drop or you know if whatever sequences I even buy in software and go through sequences saas style essays AAS and it makes their work easier and faster and it empowers them to do something and they might be using proprietary data from you know product feed that you have but if they have an issue then they should be empowered by automation by applied LLM then let's go hand in hand now to do the work then you have level 2 where you're like OK this works is greater the ad hoc tasks are being done by level 1 level 2 is more like let's be systematic about what we're actually trying to automate and achieve here and this is when the macro and the micro join together slightly because you're coming up with projects with fixed goals to say right OK i'll our time to market on a new site for a new territory is currently six months what are the levers that we can pull to bring it out to 2 1/2 things like translation or feed collection or supplier management or hiring of drivers and logistics and you know all of this stuff still make a very business specific things but it will take up time and we'll have to happen at once how do we make those faster so overall we cut that time down so this is the level two you have established systems maybe some they're like interdepartmental and they're they're run by like an overseeing AI team that's that's charged with integrating all of these different things but it still lives at team level right it's lots of different team level automations that come together to make things faster and make things more cost efficient but you're now realising the revenue implications that's level 2 level 3 at the top is like way more abstract because we're not there yet I don't think but can touch on it is that this is when you you look just remove parts of your business that were let's call it legacy built legacy built built in a time where we only had access to human resources now we have access to human resources plus LM resource and whatever else in the future and for the most part a lot of these issues go away that we had previously so you know if you're dealing with logistics of how to get your delivery from warehouse A to customer B on the traditionally with ignorant OK so I need a driver and I need to take it there and then you know maybe there's some optimization at the root but level 3 isn't is about okay how do we use applied LLMS and automation to say that we even need the driver or do we even need the customer do we even need the warehouse and these are the skunk works projects that are and D projects these are much longer loftier problem solving things there require the people like me whose have done this for their own businesses and continues to do so and loves it but you also need to you know there can be a disconnect but between the micro of what's doing and the macro level 3 because all in all it all adds to efficiencies around but I think there's this is the way that I won't go about things I don't think that um just a top down approach should work I don't think we just automation in one team is going to work and let's let's talk us about that section and that quickly so how do you how do you handle like you know there's there's a new tool for everyone that we can use it happens very rarely thank you really Google Docs was probably you know the collaborative file share probably the last time I can think of one that was really really great maybe a slack I don't know I used to play on Teamspeak and ventrilo a so like 20 years so remote collaborative experiences nothing new but for the workforce yeah definitely this were refining moments for me. Now we have teams that all want to use the same tools the same flavours of tools some of them the sales guys the moment they or the outreach guys really want to use clay dot com they really still using clay using Apollo they're using smart league they use them instantly all of these outreach I guess smartleads.Ai not Smart League and they are for the most part using wildly different tools than your traditional marketing automation guy unless I marketing automation a lot of people think oh yeah that's like email welcome series yeah we can do that with mailchimp or you know Hubspot or for the PPC guys it's going to be yeah yeah so I can create a product feed and we'll send that to ecommerce store or build at of the back of that is now product catalogue for Facebook and then you've got okay what we got there we're still generating content and we still using the same proprietary business data or 3rd party data we're just doing things a different way. A more abstract way so we we at a level of abstraction into our workflows because he's applied LLM talks like chat GPT like Claude like cursor like whatever you're ended up buying for all of the GPT wrappers they're there they add stuff away and eventually someone will look at this and say Hey we have massive software sprawl we need to cut down the amount of tools that we use because training is insane and nothing makes sense and I need to handle 50 different licence types and you let some products will do great on some things and others fail at it and they will look to standardise this so ai and applied element doesn't live in a bubble you need to stand it out at some point I believe just like all tools for software engineers you'll know that you're not going to have code across many different git types for the most part you choose one ecosystem and you live on that ecosystem for better or for worse yeah for marketing for example like what's your marketing website built in it's not like three different flavours of cmss is it but for the most part they're over here maybe you should think about consolidation but anyway what I'm what I'm trying to get to the point of here is that you don't have the luxury of using a million different tools forever because this where you're just trying to automate and you're trying to find the speed and cost efficiencies you actually end up being less efficient because everyone is so siloed and not together and it takes more time for this cost more it's more expensive to maintain all these systems because you need an expert in each of them or you over rely on 11 guy or one team to do a little and then this is like a huge issue that I saw when I had my lunch yesterday with the guy working on the AI teams is that he's just hiring python developers to throw them at tasks and that's a great way of getting spaghetti dept no no one wants that it works really well to start and you do have to go through that journey but you need the top down approach in the bottom up approach because you can't just democratise everyone's workflow does that make sense?\n\n\n\nSo I guess I'm trying to say that the right approach to applied LLMS in automation and to receive these speed and cost optimizations to win yeah with automation is you need a three tiered approach definitely start by empowering everyone to use these tools if there's pushback people say no I don't like them then you've got to think about what why don't they like is it because they're not ready to train is it because the tours that you're giving aren't good for them is it you know do you understand their role they should be good they should be very grassroots right and you should incentivize the the the efficiency gains the time to revenue the time to feature the time to X gains here and if someone shows initiative you should lead with that and encourage them more and the level two here you do need whilst you have this this lead inside a team that meant several teams you need to make sure that they have shared with everyone else in the company in your group or in your whatever sharing what tools work for them we talk about you know not just like are these these tools are great I love these tools you don't want to have lots of different tribes with their favourite setups something like yes you can but at some point you're going to want to standardise some of the stuff I would say like hey yes we use n8n here is a massive library that interacts with that product database and with everything and here are endpoints so that if you want to you know use n8n with our community nodes or our data then you can do and like fantastic that's level 2 yeah and maybe we're we'll we'll bring in some of the engineers to look at how they can do other things there as well it's great but then these this team this interdepartmental team that leads those initiatives they also need to be governed by a wider top down approach which is what the **** are we actually doing why are we doing the LLMS why why are we acting like this as a business and the question that I would ask is if your business was built today from scratch with all of the tools available to you what would it look like and what would it look like differently and this is a question that's very hard for some people because it's hard to box thinking question and this is this type of problems that I like to solve but I started by solving them for agencies because I know what it's like to to work in an agency to you know there's a lot of **** in there and there's a lot of inefficiency but it really it starts with like a top down top down goals bottom up grassroots automation and then in the middle you do need to force some sort of innovation some teams have an innovation lead others might be looking at applied LLM directors chief of LLMS Chief of automation is probably the role that I would go for but yeah just just have a think about this this is not a new problem to solve this has existed in so many different forms in web cooling and scraping in robotic process automation it's you know just a new a new team has been set up because we're now Main Street right applied LLM is Main Street whether you like it or not but it's the same flavour as the last 10 years new software comes out and we adapt and change just this one is has more potential and because we're realising games literally everywhere it's very easy to pigeonhole when you should be thinking huge levels so my takeaways from this are have someone that gives a **** about operations in your business and the automations of those operations the ceo for example is a great place to start and if they're not technical get them a right hand man that's technical i'll let it understand system can speak automation don't leave it to engineers because engineers are in a bubble they'd be great to build in but they need to you know in ultimately you need to you need to workers that are doing the work to lead the automation because they know how they're doing it and they understand the work and the inefficiencies and you need to be able to say firstly about 1 do we need to do this is this even a task that needs doing why we doing it what's the benefits to the business for doing this task too okay how do we get rid of the task and replace it with something more streamlined 3 like how do we just give you the tools needed so that you can go and do this another take away would be use a build some internal library some packages let's do software engineers you know always use some packages right would it not be great to be able to pmpm instal your business packages and use them across everything so sales and marketing have their own setups and they have a wider block of Lego books let's talk about when we do this if this article write down notebook like Lego box it's a key theme I want it to be which is like you can have some Lego that sits very specific pieces that are going to help the marketing team build just their marketing stuff very specific pieces that are going to help the sales team to scrape leagues you're still going to be Lego blocks and they're still going to be usable by everyone if they want to then you're going to have your basic blocks which you know you need some imagination to use but they're there and they took great with your business logic with your business data with your tools and your stuff and you need people to put the instructions to know what they're building you need the people with the imagination and the vision and to know that they've got taste and clarity and you know to build something beautiful there's also functional and can maybe you know not not just like a Lego statue but it's like this it's a leaving a living breathing organism or system and this is really like important to me so these are just my thoughts on the last couple days on where I see what I'm doing and the cta for this should be that I am ready to take up the reins to help companies ambitious companies across all of these aspects this is my goal this is what I'm passionate about this is what I've been doing for the last 10 years and I'm very happy to see all of the results that have all of the gains especially around the Pioneer LMS because I think it's fantastic it's bringing more people into an engineer's mindset it's it's it's making more people more productive it's helping everything to become more potentially faster more efficient more cost efficient speed efficient but also you have the opportunity to **** things up definitely make it more convoluted you need someone like me to pull this in\n\n\n\nAssistant:\n\nThe text appears to be a dictated stream of consciousness about the author's experiences and perspectives on job searching, automation, and implementing applied Large Language Models (LLMs) in business contexts. Let me analyze this content subjectively:\n\nKey topics and themes:\n\n 1. The author runs \"CV surgery\" sessions where they teach job seekers a \"top-down approach\" to job hunting that's more like sales development outreach\n 2. They discuss how traditional job applications have become ineffective, especially with AI-generated content flooding application systems\n 3. The author describes their background in software development, automation, and LLM applications\n 4. They share their experience meeting with a grocery delivery company's AI team\n 5. They outline their philosophy on how businesses should implement applied LLM technologies (using a three-tiered approach)\n 6. They emphasize the importance of both macro (top-down) and micro (bottom-up) approaches to automation\n\n\nSubjective assessment:\n\nStrengths:\n\n * The author appears to have extensive practical experience in automation and implementing LLM technologies\n * They show genuine passion for helping businesses optimize through technology\n * They have a thoughtful framework for implementing automation that considers multiple levels of the organization\n * They demonstrate awareness of potential pitfalls in automation implementation\n * They appear to have practical experience in job searching strategies that work in the current market\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n * The text is extremely unstructured, rambling, and difficult to follow (likely because it's dictated speech)\n * There's significant repetition of ideas\n * Some sections lack clear transitions or logical flow\n * There's occasional harsh language that might be off-putting in a professional context\n * The author sometimes jumps between topics without fully developing their thoughts\n\nThe content itself has valuable insights about how businesses should approach automation and LLM implementation, but it needs significant organization and refinement to be effective as an article. The three-tiered approach to LLM implementation (grass-roots empowerment, team-level systematic automation, and transformative business model changes) is a particularly strong framework.\n\nIf this is meant to be turned into an article, it would benefit from:\n\n 1. Clear section headers\n 2. A more defined narrative structure\n 3. Removal of tangential personal anecdotes\n 4. More concise expression of key ideas\n 5. Examples or case studies to illustrate concepts\n 6. A stronger, more focused conclusion or call to action\n\nOverall, there's valuable expertise and insight in this content, but it requires significant organization and editing to effectively communicate those ideas to readers.\n\nThe author has valuable automation and applied AI expertise, with a passion for optimizing business processes. There are some genuinely insightful ideas here, particularly the three-tiered approach to implementing AI in organizations:\n\n 1. Grassroots level: Empowering individual employees with tools\n 2. Middle level: Creating systematic, cross-departmental automations\n 3. Strategic level: Rethinking entire business models through the lens of AI capabilities\n\nHowever, the content is extremely unstructured and wandering - clearly a stream of consciousness that jumps between topics. The author's voice is authentic and passionate, but the article would need significant organization to be effective. The personal anecdotes about job searching and meetings with the grocery delivery company add context but sometimes distract from the core message.\n\nThe Lego block metaphor for modular automation tools is effective, and the emphasis on balancing top-down strategy with bottom-up implementation shows practical wisdom. I think with proper structure and editing, there's a valuable article here about approaching AI implementation holistically rather than through siloed technical teams.\n\nIs this meant to be refined into a more structured article? I could help organize these thoughts into a coherent structure with clear sections?\n\n\nMe:\n\nYes.\n\n\nThe article: Steal This Blueprint: Making Money with LLMs—At Scale","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/pexels-googledeepmind-17486102.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-06T08:15:34.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-06T09:06:48.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-06T08:22:24.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"67bc1b729a94ae0008edbfad","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67c960759d63740001f021eb","uuid":"e13f9cf9-8831-4641-affd-5c0030565212","title":"Steal This Blueprint: How to embrace automation with LLMs—The Right Way","slug":"steal-this-blueprint-making-money-with-llms-at-scale","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Executive Summary\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"We're in an unprecedented era for automation and Large Language Models (LLMs) adoption.

The foundation of any successful LLM implementation starts with grassroots empowerment. Successful organizations cultivate an automation engineer's mindset throughout their teams, creating willing participants rather than reluctant users.</p><h3 id=\"real-world-implementation-example-software-development-productivity\">Real-World Implementation Example: Software Development Productivity</h3><p>At Appolica, CTO Deyan Genovski made AI a core part of their software development process. Rather than imposing AI tools from the top down, they encouraged engineers to test various coding assistance tools, including GitHub Copilot, Codeium, and Tabnine. Engineers ultimately found Cursor AI most effective, achieving a <a href=\"https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/how-to-use-ai-to-increase-software\">4-5x productivity boost</a> by autonomously identifying opportunities for automation in their daily workflows.</p><p>Key productivity improvements included:</p><ul><li>80% reduction in time spent writing boilerplate code</li><li>60% faster debugging</li><li>50% faster documentation search</li></ul><p>This grassroots approach to AI implementation puts emphasis on empowering employees to identify automation opportunities in their own workflows. Before bringing in expensive consultants, start here, always.</p><h3 id=\"to-succeed-at-level-1\">To Succeed at Level 1:</h3><ul><li>Hold regular workshops to help employees spot repetitive tasks ripe for automation</li><li>Challenge existing processes by asking \"Is this even necessary?\" or \"Could we rethink the entire approach?\"</li><li>Document pain points systematically to create an opportunity backlog</li><li>Provide clear training on automation tools to demystify their usage and benefits</li><li>Celebrate automation wins publicly to drive organic adoption across the organization</li></ul><blockquote>\"The people doing the work understand it best. They know where the inefficiencies lie. Empower them to identify these opportunities, and they'll drive your automation journey forward.\"</blockquote><p>The goal is to shift from \"doing work because we've always done it this way\" to questioning every process and identifying opportunities for improvement. Remember, at Level 1, empowering employees to identify automation opportunities in their own workflows creates the foundation for all future success.</p><p>Resistance to automation usually stems from fear, confusion, or perceived irrelevance.

Building on the foundation of grassroots empowerment from Level 1, organizations now need infrastructure that supports systematic growth. </p><p>The key principle of Level 2 is modularity—creating standardized components that function like Lego blocks, which teams can assemble, reuse, and extend to solve diverse business problems. Remember that systematic integration accelerates adoption by making automation accessible to non-technical users.</p><h3 id=\"real-world-implementation-example-modular-ai-integration-at-roo\">Real-World Implementation Example: Modular AI Integration at Roo</h3><p>John Stearns, CTO at Roo, implemented a systematic approach to AI integration after initial grassroots experimentation. Building on their early success with Cursor AI, they developed their own modular AI development agent called \"Roo Code,\" allowing teams to leverage reusable components for common tasks, <a href=\"https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/how-to-use-ai-to-increase-software\">as detailed in the Engineering Leadership Newsletter</a>.</p><p>Their approach exemplifies the Lego Block Philosophy, as they:</p><ol><li>Started with standardized tools (Cursor AI)</li><li>Developed modular, reusable components (Roo Code)</li><li>Integrated these modules across different applications (web and mobile)</li><li>Established governance through tech debt contests and usage tracking</li></ol><p>This systematic integration enabled them to undertake projects they normally wouldn't have attempted, such as a complete rebuild of their search experience across web and mobile platforms. By using modular AI components, a small team of engineers completed this project in just a couple of months.</p><h3 id=\"these-modular-blocks-come-in-three-key-types\">These modular blocks come in three key types:</h3><p><strong>1. Foundation Blocks (Universal)</strong></p><p>Foundation blocks abstract away complexity and deliver core business functions that multiple teams rely on, including:</p><ul><li>Data retrieval: APIs that abstract complex database queries, simplifying data access across teams</li><li>Authentication &amp; security modules: Centralize secure data access, authorization logic, and role-based permissions</li><li>Core LLM capabilities: Sentiment analysis, summarization, and content-generation components usable by customer service, marketing, and product teams alike</li></ul><p><strong>Example:</strong> A \"Customer Data Fetcher\" block might expose standardized APIs that provide customer profiles, abstracting complex SQL queries behind a simple interface usable across all teams.</p><p><strong>2. Specialized Blocks (Cross-Functional)</strong></p><p>These blocks address common business-specific tasks, combining foundational blocks in practical ways relevant across multiple departments:</p><ul><li>Personalized email generators using customer history for marketing and customer support</li><li>Advanced customer segmentation blocks (\"Customers who've stopped buying within the last 14 days and purchased category X products previously\"), helpful in marketing, sales, and retention initiatives</li></ul><p>These components are still general enough to reuse widely but tailored for specific business scenarios.</p><p><strong>3. Team-Specific Blocks (Targeted)</strong></p><p>These are niche blocks built for single teams, solving highly specialized needs without losing compatibility with the broader system.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A marketing team might create an automation block that integrates PPC performance data from Facebook and Google Ads into a unified dashboard—specific, yet still compatible with broader data-access foundation blocks.</p><p>At this level, you need a team charged with coordinating these efforts—ensuring that automations built by different departments can interact with each other and align with the company's strategic objectives. This might be a dedicated \"AI Integration\" team or simply representatives from different departments who collaborate regularly.</p><h3 id=\"the-component-registry-making-lego-blocks-discoverable-and-reusable\">The Component Registry: Making Lego Blocks Discoverable and Reusable</h3><p>A well-designed component registry forms the heart of a successful Level 2 implementation. This system functions as a living ecosystem that defines how automation components interact within your organization:</p><p><strong>Component Registry Functions:</strong></p><ul><li>Discovery: Enables teams to find existing components without reinventing the wheel</li><li>Documentation: Provides clear schemas for inputs and outputs of each component</li><li>Governance: Manages versioning, ownership, and lifecycle of components</li><li>Integration: Generates endpoints and connection points automatically</li><li>Access Control: Ensures proper security and permissions for component usage</li></ul><p>The registry serves as the central nervous system of your automation strategy, making components discoverable and usable across departments.</p><p><strong>Practical Implementation:</strong> Each component in your registry should be defined with:</p><ul><li>Clear input schema (what data the component expects)</li><li>Well-defined output schema (what data the component returns)</li><li>Usage documentation and examples</li><li>Version history and compatibility notes</li><li>Owner and support contact information</li><li>Dependencies on other components</li><li>Performance characteristics and limitations</li></ul><p>This standardization enables the registry to automatically generate:</p><ul><li>REST API endpoints for each component</li><li>Swagger/OpenAPI documentation</li><li>SDK integrations for popular platforms</li><li>N8N community node definitions for no-code integration</li><li>Monitoring dashboards for component usage and performance</li></ul><h3 id=\"cross-departmental-governance\">Cross-Departmental Governance</h3><p>The success of your component ecosystem depends on effective governance that balances innovation with standardization:</p><p><strong>Governance Framework Elements:</strong></p><ul><li>Component Review Board: Cross-functional team that reviews new components</li><li>Deprecation Strategy: Clear timeline and communication plan for retiring components</li><li>Evolution Process: Structured approach to enhancing existing components</li><li>Quality Standards: Minimum requirements for performance, reliability, and security</li><li>Resource Allocation: Process for prioritizing new component development</li><li>Training Program: Enabling teams to effectively use and create components</li></ul><p>This governance structure ensures that your component ecosystem remains healthy, avoiding duplication while promoting innovation. Remember that your component registry requires ongoing attention and management. The system continuously evolves as an organic ecosystem that grows and changes alongside your business.</p><h3 id=\"ethical-considerations-at-level-2\">Ethical Considerations at Level 2</h3><p>As organizations build modular AI components, ethical considerations become increasingly important. The <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai\">EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI</a> emphasize \"human agency and oversight\" as a key requirement, achievable through human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, and human-in-command approaches.</p><p>At Level 2, ethical implementation includes:</p><ul><li>Building transparency into AI components, documenting how decisions are made</li><li>Implementing appropriate human oversight for critical AI components</li><li>Ensuring data privacy and security in component design</li><li>Creating mechanisms for auditing AI component performance for bias and fairness</li></ul><h2 id=\"combining-lego-blocks-into-practical-solutions\">Combining Lego Blocks into Practical Solutions</h2><p>Here's how a real-world scenario plays out with modular automation blocks:</p><p>Imagine the marketing team wants to send a barbecue-themed promotional email to \"customers who haven't repurchased within 14 days, featuring our top summer products.\"</p><p>Traditionally, this would involve:</p><ul><li>A custom database query (requiring IT involvement)</li><li>Manual export of customer data</li><li>Manual identification of best-selling products</li><li>Copywriting for the email</li><li>Building the email in a marketing platform</li><li>Sending and tracking results</li></ul><p>With modular blocks, it's seamless:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Traditional Approach</th>\n<th>Modular Block Approach</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1.

Higher customer lifetime value, lower cost of acquisition, and increased revenue. These represent both technical and business wins.</p><p><strong>What multi-step process in your organization currently takes days but could be reduced to minutes with the right automation blocks?</strong></p><h2 id=\"level-3-strategic-reinvention\">Level 3: Strategic Reinvention</h2><p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Challenge and reinvent the core assumptions of your business by fully embracing what's possible with automation.</p><p>Level 3 drives fundamental transformation. Moving beyond the optimization of existing processes (Level 1) and the creation of modular systems (Level 2), Level 3 challenges you to question the fundamental structure of your business. Strategic reinvention means reconsidering your entire business model in light of automation possibilities.</p><h3 id=\"real-world-implementation-example-strategic-reinvention-at-roo\">Real-World Implementation Example: Strategic Reinvention at Roo</h3><p>John Stearns, CTO at Roo, exemplifies Level 3 strategic reinvention in his approach to organization-wide AI adoption. After successfully implementing modular AI components at Level 2, Roo rethought their fundamental organizational structure to leverage AI capabilities fully:</p><p>\"As 2025 planning began, they reflected on what AI had enabled within their team. By leveraging AI tools effectively, they realized they could double the number of product squads without significantly increasing engineering headcount. Instead of maintaining three or four squads, they are now planning eight product squads, each consisting of just one or two engineers, augmented by AI.\" - <a href=\"https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/how-to-use-ai-to-increase-software\">John Stearns, CTO at Roo</a>[3]</p><p>This represents true strategic reinvention—not just using AI to improve existing processes, but completely reimagining their organizational structure based on what AI makes possible.</p><p>At this level, ask transformative questions like: \"If we were building this business today, with all the tools available to us, what would it look like?\"</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Traditional Question</th>\n<th>Level 3 Question</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>How can we optimize our department structure?</td>\n<td>Do we need traditional departments at all with AI?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How can we improve our product?</td>\n<td>Could AI enable entirely new product categories?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How can we enhance customer touchpoints?</td>\n<td>What if the customer journey was completely reimagined?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How can we optimize our supply chain?</td>\n<td>Do we need the same physical infrastructure at all?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>These are the \"skunk works\" projects—R&amp;D initiatives that might seem speculative but could completely transform your business. They require people who have built automated systems from scratch and understand both the technical possibilities and the business implications.</p><p>This level requires a different mindset:</p><ul><li>Long-term thinking: These initiatives may not pay off immediately</li><li>Tolerance for failure: Not every idea will succeed</li><li>Cross-disciplinary collaboration: Combining technical expertise with domain knowledge</li><li>Executive sponsorship: These initiatives need protection from short-term pressures</li></ul><p>While Levels 1 and 2 can often be implemented within existing organizational structures, Level 3 typically requires dedicated teams with direct reporting lines to executive leadership. These teams need the freedom to explore radical ideas without immediate pressure to deliver results.</p><p>Even at this strategic level, the component registry from Level 2 plays a crucial role:</p><ul><li>It provides a clear inventory of current automation capabilities</li><li>It highlights gaps that might represent strategic opportunities</li><li>It enables rapid prototyping of new business models by leveraging existing components</li><li>It supports controlled migration from legacy approaches to new business models</li><li></li><li><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> What fundamental assumptions about your business model would you challenge if starting from scratch today?</li></ul><h2 id=\"level-4-autonomous-growth\">Level 4: Autonomous Growth</h2><p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Foster autonomous, self-improving systems that proactively identify, experiment, and optimize business processes—guided by human oversight for strategic direction and ethics.</p><p>Level 4 represents a paradigm shift from the previous levels where humans actively participate in the automation journey. After mastering empowerment (Level 1), modular systems (Level 2), and strategic reinvention (Level 3), organizations can embrace truly autonomous growth. At Level 4, systems themselves identify opportunities, build solutions, and implement improvements with minimal human intervention.</p><p>This concept exists beyond theoretical discussion. We already see the early stages of this transition, and organizations that start preparing now will gain significant advantages as these capabilities mature.</p><blockquote>\"The most advanced organizations create ecosystems where automation continuously improves itself.\"</blockquote><h3 id=\"real-world-implementation-example-early-autonomous-growth-at-roo\">Real-World Implementation Example: Early Autonomous Growth at Roo</h3><p>While few organizations have fully implemented Level 4 autonomous growth, <a href=\"https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/how-to-use-ai-to-increase-software\">Roo's approach</a> demonstrates early progress toward this goal. Their AI-driven code review system using Ellipsis represents a step toward autonomous growth, as it automatically identifies issues and suggests improvements without requiring human initiation.</p><p>Their future roadmap includes even more autonomous capabilities:</p><ul><li>Automating QA through AI-generated Cypress integration tests</li><li>Implementing autonomous bug fixing</li><li>Optimizing development workflows through AI-driven refinements</li></ul><p>These initiatives illustrate the transition from human-directed AI to increasingly autonomous systems that proactively identify opportunities for improvement.</p><p>Imagine a marketing department where Level 4 automation is in place:</p><p>The system continuously analyzes campaign performance, customer feedback, and market trends.

At Tintash, Senior Engineering Manager Moiz Imran described <a href=\"https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/how-to-use-ai-to-increase-software\">how their team evaluated multiple AI tools</a> before finding what worked best for their needs:</p><p>\"They started with a very basic replacement of Stack Overflow with ChatGPT... This improved productivity slightly as it reduced 'googling' time. However, AI was still prone to giving the wrong solutions. [Later they] started using code suggestion tools like Github Copilot, Codeium, Cody, etc... The ultimate productivity increase came as a result of Cursor. Engineers can feed more context to the AI and also it allows them to experiment with different LLMs, with Claude Sonnet coming out as a favorite.\"</p><p>This example illustrates the importance of evaluating tools based on their practical capabilities rather than popularity or convenience.</p><p>Choose tools based on practicality, scalability, and real-world usage, not just developer convenience or historical precedent.</p><p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Are you selecting technologies based on your team's existing skills or based on what will best serve your business needs?</p><h3 id=\"managing-tool-proliferation\">Managing Tool Proliferation</h3><p>As teams adopt LLMs and automation, there's a natural tendency toward tool proliferation. Sales teams want Clay.com and Apollo; marketing teams want Mailchimp and Hubspot; product teams want their own specialized tools.</p><p>This creates several problems:</p><ul><li>Training complexity: Employees need to learn multiple systems</li><li>Integration challenges: Data gets siloed in different platforms</li><li>License management: IT teams struggle to track and manage licenses</li><li>Support issues: When something breaks, who's responsible?</li></ul><h3 id=\"real-world-implementation-example-tool-governance-at-signal-ai\">Real-World Implementation Example: Tool Governance at Signal AI</h3><p>Shaun Wallace, Director of Engineering at Signal AI, addressed tool proliferation by developing clear guidelines for AI tool usage based on their collective experience with various tools including Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor:</p><p>\"Based on their collective experience, they've developed these guidelines:</p><ul><li>Do leverage AI for code suggestions, variable renaming, module imports, and boilerplate generation.</li><li>Do use type annotations in Python to guide AI toward better implementations.</li><li>Don't rely on AI for complex data or pipeline design problems.</li><li>Use cautiously when writing code snippets or modifying data structures, and always verify the output.\"</li></ul><p>These guidelines help manage tool proliferation by clearly defining when and how AI tools should be used, preventing the adoption of redundant solutions while still allowing for innovation.</p><p>Without proper management, automation inevitably creates tool sprawl. Successful organizations address this through effective governance without stifling innovation:</p><ul><li>Establish a clear registry of available blocks and their capabilities</li><li>Document rigorously—define capabilities, dependencies, and intended usage clearly</li><li>Create development guidelines for new blocks</li><li>Implement a lightweight review process for shared components</li><li>Regularly prune redundant components to avoid technical debt</li><li>Develop a strategy for retiring outdated blocks when better alternatives exist</li></ul><p>This governance should enable innovation while preventing chaos. Create \"building codes\" for your modular automation components that ensure safety, reliability, and compatibility without dictating exactly how people use them.

Organizations everywhere are rushing into AI implementation, yet most fall into the same predictable traps: isolated projects disconnected from broader strategy, technical solutions separated from practical operations, and a messy proliferation of tools that dilute strategic impact.\n\n\"The companies that thrive with automation and applied LLMs aren't necessarily the ones with the biggest budgets or most PhDs—they're the ones connecting high-level business strategy to tangible ground-level execution.\"\n\nThis enhanced framework provides a structured roadmap for organizations at any stage of their AI journey, from initial exploration to advanced autonomous systems. By integrating real-world case studies, ethical considerations, and practical implementation strategies, this guide offers a blueprint for turning AI potential into tangible business outcomes.\n\n\nBridging the Macro and Micro Gap\n\nAt the macro level, executives see automation as a lever to speed growth, increase revenues, and cut overhead costs. They want to see tangible benefits: cutting three months off a 12-month market expansion plan, realizing revenue faster, and reducing overhead costs.\n\nAt the micro level, individual employees simply want tools to streamline day-to-day tasks—generating email content, updating product data, or automating customer interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerspective\nFocus\nPrimary Concerns\nSuccess Metrics\n\n\n\n\nMacro (Executive)\nStrategic advantage\nMarket expansion, revenue acceleration\nRevenue growth, cost reduction, market share\n\n\nMicro (Employee)\nDaily productivity\nSimplified tasks, reduced friction\nTime saved, ease of use, quality of output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen these two levels aren't aligned, automation initiatives stall or fail.\n\nThe solution? Adopting a modular, three-tiered approach that bridges this gap, maximizing value at every level of the organization.\n\nAsk yourself: Do your automation initiatives connect executive priorities with frontline employee needs?\n\n\nThe Four-Tiered Approach to Applied LLMs and Automation\n\nDrawing on years of hands-on experience implementing automation across various industries, here's a structured roadmap enhanced with real-world implementation examples:\n\n\nLevel 1: Grassroots Empowerment\n\nCore principle: Empower every employee to identify and act upon automation opportunities within their own workflows.\n\nAutomation requires genuine adoption, not mandates from leadership. The foundation of any successful LLM implementation starts with grassroots empowerment. Successful organizations cultivate an automation engineer's mindset throughout their teams, creating willing participants rather than reluctant users.\n\n\nReal-World Implementation Example: Software Development Productivity\n\nAt Appolica, CTO Deyan Genovski made AI a core part of their software development process. Rather than imposing AI tools from the top down, they encouraged engineers to test various coding assistance tools, including GitHub Copilot, Codeium, and Tabnine. Engineers ultimately found Cursor AI most effective, achieving a 4-5x productivity boost by autonomously identifying opportunities for automation in their daily workflows.\n\nKey productivity improvements included:\n\n * 80% reduction in time spent writing boilerplate code\n * 60% faster debugging\n * 50% faster documentation search\n\nThis grassroots approach to AI implementation puts emphasis on empowering employees to identify automation opportunities in their own workflows. Before bringing in expensive consultants, start here, always.\n\n\nTo Succeed at Level 1:\n\n * Hold regular workshops to help employees spot repetitive tasks ripe for automation\n * Challenge existing processes by asking \"Is this even necessary?\" or \"Could we rethink the entire approach?\"\n * Document pain points systematically to create an opportunity backlog\n * Provide clear training on automation tools to demystify their usage and benefits\n * Celebrate automation wins publicly to drive organic adoption across the organization\n\n\"The people doing the work understand it best. They know where the inefficiencies lie. Empower them to identify these opportunities, and they'll drive your automation journey forward.\"\n\nThe goal is to shift from \"doing work because we've always done it this way\" to questioning every process and identifying opportunities for improvement. Remember, at Level 1, empowering employees to identify automation opportunities in their own workflows creates the foundation for all future success.\n\nResistance to automation usually stems from fear, confusion, or perceived irrelevance. When employees encounter resistance, don't dismiss it. Understand its source:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResistance Type\nSigns\nHow to Address\n\n\n\n\nFear of job displacement\n\"Will this replace me?\"\nFocus on augmentation over replacement, demonstrate how automation handles tedious work\n\n\nTool unfamiliarity\n\"This is too complex\"\nProvide hands-on training, create simple guides, assign mentors\n\n\nSolution mismatch\n\"This doesn't solve my problem\"\nInvolve users in solution design, iterate based on feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction point: Identify one repetitive task in your department this week that could be automated. Document the current process steps and time investment.\n\n\nLevel 2: Systematic Integration with Lego Block Philosophy\n\nCore principle: Create modular, reusable automation components that standardize processes, eliminate redundancy, and promote cross-functional collaboration.\n\nThis is where automation starts to scale. Building on the foundation of grassroots empowerment from Level 1, organizations now need infrastructure that supports systematic growth.\n\nThe key principle of Level 2 is modularity—creating standardized components that function like Lego blocks, which teams can assemble, reuse, and extend to solve diverse business problems. Remember that systematic integration accelerates adoption by making automation accessible to non-technical users.\n\n\nReal-World Implementation Example: Modular AI Integration at Roo\n\nJohn Stearns, CTO at Roo, implemented a systematic approach to AI integration after initial grassroots experimentation. Building on their early success with Cursor AI, they developed their own modular AI development agent called \"Roo Code,\" allowing teams to leverage reusable components for common tasks, as detailed in the Engineering Leadership Newsletter.\n\nTheir approach exemplifies the Lego Block Philosophy, as they:\n\n 1. Started with standardized tools (Cursor AI)\n 2. Developed modular, reusable components (Roo Code)\n 3. Integrated these modules across different applications (web and mobile)\n 4. Established governance through tech debt contests and usage tracking\n\nThis systematic integration enabled them to undertake projects they normally wouldn't have attempted, such as a complete rebuild of their search experience across web and mobile platforms. By using modular AI components, a small team of engineers completed this project in just a couple of months.\n\n\nThese modular blocks come in three key types:\n\n1. Foundation Blocks (Universal)\n\nFoundation blocks abstract away complexity and deliver core business functions that multiple teams rely on, including:\n\n * Data retrieval: APIs that abstract complex database queries, simplifying data access across teams\n * Authentication & security modules: Centralize secure data access, authorization logic, and role-based permissions\n * Core LLM capabilities: Sentiment analysis, summarization, and content-generation components usable by customer service, marketing, and product teams alike\n\nExample: A \"Customer Data Fetcher\" block might expose standardized APIs that provide customer profiles, abstracting complex SQL queries behind a simple interface usable across all teams.\n\n2. Specialized Blocks (Cross-Functional)\n\nThese blocks address common business-specific tasks, combining foundational blocks in practical ways relevant across multiple departments:\n\n * Personalized email generators using customer history for marketing and customer support\n * Advanced customer segmentation blocks (\"Customers who've stopped buying within the last 14 days and purchased category X products previously\"), helpful in marketing, sales, and retention initiatives\n\nThese components are still general enough to reuse widely but tailored for specific business scenarios.\n\n3. Team-Specific Blocks (Targeted)\n\nThese are niche blocks built for single teams, solving highly specialized needs without losing compatibility with the broader system.\n\nExample: A marketing team might create an automation block that integrates PPC performance data from Facebook and Google Ads into a unified dashboard—specific, yet still compatible with broader data-access foundation blocks.\n\nAt this level, you need a team charged with coordinating these efforts—ensuring that automations built by different departments can interact with each other and align with the company's strategic objectives. This might be a dedicated \"AI Integration\" team or simply representatives from different departments who collaborate regularly.\n\n\nThe Component Registry: Making Lego Blocks Discoverable and Reusable\n\nA well-designed component registry forms the heart of a successful Level 2 implementation. This system functions as a living ecosystem that defines how automation components interact within your organization:\n\nComponent Registry Functions:\n\n * Discovery: Enables teams to find existing components without reinventing the wheel\n * Documentation: Provides clear schemas for inputs and outputs of each component\n * Governance: Manages versioning, ownership, and lifecycle of components\n * Integration: Generates endpoints and connection points automatically\n * Access Control: Ensures proper security and permissions for component usage\n\nThe registry serves as the central nervous system of your automation strategy, making components discoverable and usable across departments.\n\nPractical Implementation: Each component in your registry should be defined with:\n\n * Clear input schema (what data the component expects)\n * Well-defined output schema (what data the component returns)\n * Usage documentation and examples\n * Version history and compatibility notes\n * Owner and support contact information\n * Dependencies on other components\n * Performance characteristics and limitations\n\nThis standardization enables the registry to automatically generate:\n\n * REST API endpoints for each component\n * Swagger/OpenAPI documentation\n * SDK integrations for popular platforms\n * N8N community node definitions for no-code integration\n * Monitoring dashboards for component usage and performance\n\n\nCross-Departmental Governance\n\nThe success of your component ecosystem depends on effective governance that balances innovation with standardization:\n\nGovernance Framework Elements:\n\n * Component Review Board: Cross-functional team that reviews new components\n * Deprecation Strategy: Clear timeline and communication plan for retiring components\n * Evolution Process: Structured approach to enhancing existing components\n * Quality Standards: Minimum requirements for performance, reliability, and security\n * Resource Allocation: Process for prioritizing new component development\n * Training Program: Enabling teams to effectively use and create components\n\nThis governance structure ensures that your component ecosystem remains healthy, avoiding duplication while promoting innovation. Remember that your component registry requires ongoing attention and management. The system continuously evolves as an organic ecosystem that grows and changes alongside your business.\n\n\nEthical Considerations at Level 2\n\nAs organizations build modular AI components, ethical considerations become increasingly important. The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI emphasize \"human agency and oversight\" as a key requirement, achievable through human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, and human-in-command approaches.\n\nAt Level 2, ethical implementation includes:\n\n * Building transparency into AI components, documenting how decisions are made\n * Implementing appropriate human oversight for critical AI components\n * Ensuring data privacy and security in component design\n * Creating mechanisms for auditing AI component performance for bias and fairness\n\n\nCombining Lego Blocks into Practical Solutions\n\nHere's how a real-world scenario plays out with modular automation blocks:\n\nImagine the marketing team wants to send a barbecue-themed promotional email to \"customers who haven't repurchased within 14 days, featuring our top summer products.\"\n\nTraditionally, this would involve:\n\n * A custom database query (requiring IT involvement)\n * Manual export of customer data\n * Manual identification of best-selling products\n * Copywriting for the email\n * Building the email in a marketing platform\n * Sending and tracking results\n\nWith modular blocks, it's seamless:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTraditional Approach\nModular Block Approach\n\n\n\n\n1. Customer Selection\nIT creates custom query\nUse Customer Filter block\n\n\n2. Product Selection\nManual analysis of sales data\nAdd Product Recommendation block\n\n\n3. Content Creation\nCopywriter drafts email\nApply Email Content Generator\n\n\n4. Execution\nManual build in email platform\nExecute via Email Campaign block\n\n\nTime Required\nDays\nMinutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The entire workflow takes minutes rather than days, directly aligning automation with tangible business outcomes.\"\n\nThe business impact is substantial:\n\n * Faster campaign execution (improving time-to-market)\n * Better personalization (improving conversion rates)\n * Easier testing and refinement (improving ROI)\n * Reduced dependency on technical teams (lowering costs)\n\nThe result? Higher customer lifetime value, lower cost of acquisition, and increased revenue. These represent both technical and business wins.\n\nWhat multi-step process in your organization currently takes days but could be reduced to minutes with the right automation blocks?\n\n\nLevel 3: Strategic Reinvention\n\nCore Principle: Challenge and reinvent the core assumptions of your business by fully embracing what's possible with automation.\n\nLevel 3 drives fundamental transformation. Moving beyond the optimization of existing processes (Level 1) and the creation of modular systems (Level 2), Level 3 challenges you to question the fundamental structure of your business. Strategic reinvention means reconsidering your entire business model in light of automation possibilities.\n\n\nReal-World Implementation Example: Strategic Reinvention at Roo\n\nJohn Stearns, CTO at Roo, exemplifies Level 3 strategic reinvention in his approach to organization-wide AI adoption. After successfully implementing modular AI components at Level 2, Roo rethought their fundamental organizational structure to leverage AI capabilities fully:\n\n\"As 2025 planning began, they reflected on what AI had enabled within their team. By leveraging AI tools effectively, they realized they could double the number of product squads without significantly increasing engineering headcount. Instead of maintaining three or four squads, they are now planning eight product squads, each consisting of just one or two engineers, augmented by AI.\" - John Stearns, CTO at Roo[3]\n\nThis represents true strategic reinvention—not just using AI to improve existing processes, but completely reimagining their organizational structure based on what AI makes possible.\n\nAt this level, ask transformative questions like: \"If we were building this business today, with all the tools available to us, what would it look like?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Question\nLevel 3 Question\n\n\n\n\nHow can we optimize our department structure?\nDo we need traditional departments at all with AI?\n\n\nHow can we improve our product?\nCould AI enable entirely new product categories?\n\n\nHow can we enhance customer touchpoints?\nWhat if the customer journey was completely reimagined?\n\n\nHow can we optimize our supply chain?\nDo we need the same physical infrastructure at all?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the \"skunk works\" projects—R&D initiatives that might seem speculative but could completely transform your business. They require people who have built automated systems from scratch and understand both the technical possibilities and the business implications.\n\nThis level requires a different mindset:\n\n * Long-term thinking: These initiatives may not pay off immediately\n * Tolerance for failure: Not every idea will succeed\n * Cross-disciplinary collaboration: Combining technical expertise with domain knowledge\n * Executive sponsorship: These initiatives need protection from short-term pressures\n\nWhile Levels 1 and 2 can often be implemented within existing organizational structures, Level 3 typically requires dedicated teams with direct reporting lines to executive leadership. These teams need the freedom to explore radical ideas without immediate pressure to deliver results.\n\nEven at this strategic level, the component registry from Level 2 plays a crucial role:\n\n * It provides a clear inventory of current automation capabilities\n * It highlights gaps that might represent strategic opportunities\n * It enables rapid prototyping of new business models by leveraging existing components\n * It supports controlled migration from legacy approaches to new business models\n * \n * Ask yourself: What fundamental assumptions about your business model would you challenge if starting from scratch today?\n\n\nLevel 4: Autonomous Growth\n\nCore Principle: Foster autonomous, self-improving systems that proactively identify, experiment, and optimize business processes—guided by human oversight for strategic direction and ethics.\n\nLevel 4 represents a paradigm shift from the previous levels where humans actively participate in the automation journey. After mastering empowerment (Level 1), modular systems (Level 2), and strategic reinvention (Level 3), organizations can embrace truly autonomous growth. At Level 4, systems themselves identify opportunities, build solutions, and implement improvements with minimal human intervention.\n\nThis concept exists beyond theoretical discussion. We already see the early stages of this transition, and organizations that start preparing now will gain significant advantages as these capabilities mature.\n\n\"The most advanced organizations create ecosystems where automation continuously improves itself.\"\n\n\nReal-World Implementation Example: Early Autonomous Growth at Roo\n\nWhile few organizations have fully implemented Level 4 autonomous growth, Roo's approach demonstrates early progress toward this goal. Their AI-driven code review system using Ellipsis represents a step toward autonomous growth, as it automatically identifies issues and suggests improvements without requiring human initiation.\n\nTheir future roadmap includes even more autonomous capabilities:\n\n * Automating QA through AI-generated Cypress integration tests\n * Implementing autonomous bug fixing\n * Optimizing development workflows through AI-driven refinements\n\nThese initiatives illustrate the transition from human-directed AI to increasingly autonomous systems that proactively identify opportunities for improvement.\n\nImagine a marketing department where Level 4 automation is in place:\n\nThe system continuously analyzes campaign performance, customer feedback, and market trends.

The human marketing team evolves to a more strategic role, elevated beyond routine execution. Instead of executing campaigns, they focus on strategic questions:\n\n * Are we targeting the right market segments?\n * What new products should we develop?\n * How do our brand values inform our messaging?\n * When should we override the system's recommendations based on factors it can't see?\n\nBuilding systems capable of autonomous growth requires several key components:\n\n * Meta-learning capabilities: Systems that can learn how to learn\n * Self-assessment mechanisms: The ability to evaluate performance objectively\n * Experimental frameworks: Safe environments for testing new approaches\n * Knowledge repositories: Structured information stores capturing insights and lessons\n * Cross-domain reasoning: The ability to transfer learnings between business areas\n * Human interfaces for governance: Dashboards and alert systems for intervention\n\nThe most challenging aspect of Level 4 goes beyond technology. The true challenge lies in organizational transformation, requiring humans to evolve from implementers to governors and strategic directors.\n\n\nHuman-AI Collaboration at Level 4\n\nAt Level 4, the relationship between humans and AI systems evolves significantly. Rather than humans directing AI tools, Level 4 implementation establishes a collaborative partnership where:\n\n * AI systems proactively identify opportunities and suggest solutions\n * Humans provide strategic guidance, ethical oversight, and creative direction\n * Teams focus on governance rather than implementation\n * Organizations develop new metrics for measuring the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration\n\nAs noted in research on human-AI collaboration, \"The most advanced organizations create ecosystems where automation continuously improves itself while maintaining human oversight for strategic direction and ethical considerations.\"\n\nWhat area of your business would benefit most from self-improving automation? Where would autonomous optimization create the greatest impact?\n\n\nPractical Considerations for Avoiding Pitfalls\n\n\nTech Stack Decisions Beyond Python\n\nJust because all major AI libraries are built in Python doesn't mean Python is always the best choice for applied LLM solutions—especially user-facing ones.\n\nPython's limitations become apparent when building production systems: \"Python excels at AI development but struggles with AI deployment at scale, particularly for web-based applications.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nPython Limitations\nBetter Alternatives\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\nGlobal Interpreter Lock limits threading\nNode.js, Go, Rust\n\n\nWeb Scalability\nDjango/Flask adequate but limited\nNext.js, NestJS, Fastify\n\n\nDependency Management\nVirtual environments, pip, conda—complex at scale\nnpm/yarn with package.json\n\n\nAsync Processing\nLimited even with FastAPI\nNative in Node.js\n\n\nFrontend Integration\nPoor fit for modern web development\nJavaScript/TypeScript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most applied LLM applications, especially those with significant web components, a TypeScript-based stack provides substantial advantages:\n\n * Superior Web Performance: Next.js, NestJS, or Fastify outperform Flask/Django for real-time AI inference\n * Full-Stack Coherence: One language for frontend and backend\n * Better Async Handling: Native event-driven architecture\n * Modern Development Experience: Hot module replacement, strong typing, better tooling\n\nThe ideal approach often involves:\n\n * Python for AI model training and data science\n * TypeScript/JavaScript for web applications and APIs\n * Microservices architecture to let each shine where appropriate\n\n\nReal-World Implementation Example: Choosing the Right Tools\n\nSeveral engineering leaders highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate tools for specific contexts rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach. At Tintash, Senior Engineering Manager Moiz Imran described how their team evaluated multiple AI tools before finding what worked best for their needs:\n\n\"They started with a very basic replacement of Stack Overflow with ChatGPT... This improved productivity slightly as it reduced 'googling' time. However, AI was still prone to giving the wrong solutions. [Later they] started using code suggestion tools like Github Copilot, Codeium, Cody, etc... The ultimate productivity increase came as a result of Cursor. Engineers can feed more context to the AI and also it allows them to experiment with different LLMs, with Claude Sonnet coming out as a favorite.\"\n\nThis example illustrates the importance of evaluating tools based on their practical capabilities rather than popularity or convenience.\n\nChoose tools based on practicality, scalability, and real-world usage, not just developer convenience or historical precedent.\n\nAsk yourself: Are you selecting technologies based on your team's existing skills or based on what will best serve your business needs?\n\n\nManaging Tool Proliferation\n\nAs teams adopt LLMs and automation, there's a natural tendency toward tool proliferation. Sales teams want Clay.com and Apollo; marketing teams want Mailchimp and Hubspot; product teams want their own specialized tools.\n\nThis creates several problems:\n\n * Training complexity: Employees need to learn multiple systems\n * Integration challenges: Data gets siloed in different platforms\n * License management: IT teams struggle to track and manage licenses\n * Support issues: When something breaks, who's responsible?\n\n\nReal-World Implementation Example: Tool Governance at Signal AI\n\nShaun Wallace, Director of Engineering at Signal AI, addressed tool proliferation by developing clear guidelines for AI tool usage based on their collective experience with various tools including Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor:\n\n\"Based on their collective experience, they've developed these guidelines:\n\n * Do leverage AI for code suggestions, variable renaming, module imports, and boilerplate generation.\n * Do use type annotations in Python to guide AI toward better implementations.\n * Don't rely on AI for complex data or pipeline design problems.\n * Use cautiously when writing code snippets or modifying data structures, and always verify the output.\"\n\nThese guidelines help manage tool proliferation by clearly defining when and how AI tools should be used, preventing the adoption of redundant solutions while still allowing for innovation.\n\nWithout proper management, automation inevitably creates tool sprawl. Successful organizations address this through effective governance without stifling innovation:\n\n * Establish a clear registry of available blocks and their capabilities\n * Document rigorously—define capabilities, dependencies, and intended usage clearly\n * Create development guidelines for new blocks\n * Implement a lightweight review process for shared components\n * Regularly prune redundant components to avoid technical debt\n * Develop a strategy for retiring outdated blocks when better alternatives exist\n\nThis governance should enable innovation while preventing chaos. Create \"building codes\" for your modular automation components that ensure safety, reliability, and compatibility without dictating exactly how people use them. Just as Level 2 emphasizes modularity, your governance approach should reflect the same principles of standardization and flexibility.\n\nAction point: Schedule a cross-functional meeting to identify all automation tools currently in use across your organization. Look for overlaps and integration gaps.\n\n\nMeasuring Success: A Framework for Business Impact\n\nA comprehensive measurement framework is essential for tracking progress and justifying continued investment as organizations advance through implementation levels. Research shows that infusing AI into processes leads to specific business outcomes: improved operational optimization (92%), enhanced buyer experience (93%), improved agility (91%), and efficiency (94%).\n\n\nMeasurement Framework by Implementation Level\n\n\n\n\nLevelTechnical MetricsBusiness OutcomesExample KPIsLevel 1: Grassroots Empowerment- Number of automated processes - Time saved per process - User adoption rates- Productivity gains<br>- Employee satisfaction - Error reduction- 80% reduction in time for boilerplate tasks<br>- 60% faster debugging<br>- 50% faster documentation searchesLevel 2: Systematic Integration- Component reuse rate<br>- Integration speed<br>- System reliability- Cross-functional efficiency<br>- Increased agility<br>- Reduced dependencies- Days-to-minutes workflow compression<br>- 60% reduction in manual reviews<br>- 50% faster time-to-marketLevel 3: Strategic Reinvention- New capabilities delivered<br>- Legacy systems replaced<br>- Process simplification- New revenue streams<br>- Market expansion<br>- Competitive differentiation- 2x product development capacity<br>- 30% reduction in operational costs<br>- New market penetration metricsLevel 4: Autonomous Growth- Self-improvement rate<br>- Autonomous decision accuracy<br>- Human intervention frequency- Business model innovation<br>- Predictive capabilities<br>- Organizational adaptability- Real-time optimization metrics<br>- Predictive accuracy rates<br>- Human-AI collaboration effectiveness\n\n\n\nBy tracking both technical metrics and business outcomes at each implementation level, organizations can ensure their AI investments deliver tangible value while building the case for continued advancement through the framework.\n\n\nToward Autonomous Organizations\n\nUltimately, adopting this blueprint positions your business to evolve into a truly autonomous organization—one where automation isn't just supplementary but foundational, reshaping structures, workflows, and strategies.\n\nTaking Level 4 to its logical conclusion leads us to an even more profound transformation: systems that don't just improve themselves but actively expand their capabilities by incorporating new elements—both human and artificial.\n\n\"We must consider both how to automate our business and what happens when businesses themselves become autonomous systems.\"\n\nImagine a future where automation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Organization\nAutonomous Organization\n\n\n\n\nHiring takes weeks or months\nSystem identifies talent gaps and recruits specialists autonomously\n\n\nNew capabilities require significant integration work\nSystem discovers and integrates complementary AI agents\n\n\nNew departments require planning and approvals\nSystem creates sub-systems for emerging opportunities\n\n\nResource allocation is quarterly or annual\nResources are dynamically reconfigured based on real-time priorities\n\n\nTeam formation is slow and deliberate\nTeams form and dissolve in days rather than months\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this stage, the boundary between organization and technology dissolves completely. The \"system\" becomes the organization itself, continuously reconfiguring its components—human, technological, and financial—to maximize effectiveness.\n\nHumans aren't eliminated in this scenario but fill fundamentally different roles:\n\n * Domain specialists brought in for novel challenges\n * Ethical guardians ensuring alignment with human values\n * Creative partners proposing new directions\n * \"Diplomats\" interfacing between autonomous systems and traditional entities\n\nIn this world, automation isn't just a competitive edge; it defines what a business can become, transcending traditional constraints to unlock unimaginable efficiency and innovation.\n\nHow would your organization's structure evolve if it could dynamically reconfigure itself based on real-time priorities?\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe companies that master the integration of automation at all levels will own the future. They systematically build from grassroots empowerment (Level 1), through modular systems (Level 2), to strategic reinvention (Level 3), and ultimately toward autonomous growth (Level 4).\n\n\"Success in the age of applied LLMs comes from successfully integrating automation across all organizational levels—from individual productivity to strategic reinvention.\"\n\nThis journey requires balancing technical expertise with business acumen. Leaders must understand both LLM capabilities and strategic business objectives. Organizations need cultures that value both innovation and systematic integration.\n\nRemember the core principles that drive success at each level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nFocus\nCore Principle\nKey Action\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1\nGrassroots Empowerment\nEmpower every employee to identify automation opportunities\nStart with simple, high-value automation wins\n\n\nLevel 2\nSystematic Integration\nCreate modular, reusable components that standardize while enabling flexibility\nBuild a library of automation \"Lego blocks\" with a well-governed registry\n\n\nLevel 3\nStrategic Reinvention\nChallenge fundamental business assumptions\nRethink your business model from first principles\n\n\nLevel 4\nAutonomous Growth\nFoster self-improving systems with humans as strategic directors\nCreate systems that improve themselves\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, success with automation and LLMs comes from aligning strategic vision with practical execution, and creating a culture that drives continuous innovation at every level.\n\nIf you're ready to turn applied LLMs and automation into strategic business outcomes, let's talk: doug@withseismic.com","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/photo-1556139954-ec19cce61d61.jpeg","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-06T08:44:37.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-20T12:57:39.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-06T09:02:04.000Z","custom_excerpt":"This is a practical guide to embracing automation with LLMs in your business; from top-down to grassroots up.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"67bc1b729a94ae0008edbfad","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67c974a79d63740001f02250","uuid":"625b67fa-8a3c-4173-aecb-4e122c169d01","title":"Briefing Notes: Steal This Blueprint: Making Money with LLMs—At Scale","slug":"briefing-notes-steal-this-blueprint-making-money-with-llms-at-scale","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"\\\"Steal This Blueprint: Making Money with LLMs—At Scale\\\"\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Source:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" Excerpts from \\\"Steal This Blueprint: Making Money with LLMs—At Scale\\\" by Doug Silkstone (withSeismic.com, 06 Mar 2025) \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"type\":\"linebreak\",\"version\":1},{\"type\":\"linebreak\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Steal This Blueprint: How Real Businesses Money with LLMs—At Scale\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"link\",\"version\":1,\"rel\":null,\"target\":null,\"title\":null,\"url\":\"__GHOST_URL__/steal-this-blueprint-making-money-with-llms-at-scale/\"}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Date of Briefing:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" 16 May 2024 (based on current date)\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Prepared for:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" [Interviewers, Journalists, Thought Leaders]\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Executive Summary:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"This briefing document summarises the key themes and actionable insights from Doug Silkstone's article, \\\"Steal This Blueprint: Making Money with LLMs—At Scale.\\\" The article argues that successful implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation within businesses hinges on bridging the gap between high-level business strategy and ground-level operational realities.

Silkstone, drawing on over 15 years of experience in automation, presents a three-tiered \"Lego Block Philosophy\" framework for achieving this, emphasising grassroots empowerment, systematic integration, and strategic reinvention. He critiques common pitfalls such as siloed technical implementations, lack of employee adoption, and an over-reliance on specific technologies like Python at the expense of user-centric solutions. The article champions a holistic approach that prioritises business outcomes, employee involvement, and the creation of modular, reusable automation components.</p><p><strong>Main Themes and Important Ideas:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>The Disconnect Between Vision and Implementation:</strong> Many companies are eager to adopt LLMs but struggle due to a lack of connection between strategic goals and practical execution. Technical teams often work in isolation, focusing on the technology itself rather than business impact and user adoption. Silkstone observed this in a conversation with Marek Paris of Rohlik Group, noting a predominant interest in \"frameworks and tech stacks\" over \"techniques, agentic workflows, or the philosophical approaches to building these systems.\" He argues that \"the biggest hurdle in automation isn't technical implementation—it's adoption.\"</li><li><strong>The Importance of Grassroots Empowerment (Level 1):</strong> Successful LLM implementation begins by empowering every employee to identify and implement automation opportunities within their own workflows. This involves running workshops, encouraging critical thinking about existing processes, promoting documentation of pain points, and training employees on available tools. Silkstone firmly believes that \"without employee buy-in and initiative, even the most sophisticated automation tools will sit unused.\" He uses the analogy: \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink.\" Creating incentives, celebrating successes, and addressing employee resistance are crucial for fostering an \"automation engineer's mindset.\"</li><li><strong>Systematic Integration Through Modular Components (Level 2):</strong> Once a culture of automation is cultivated, the next step is to build a cohesive system of modular, reusable automation components – the \"Lego Block Philosophy.\" This involves creating \"community nodes with n8n or similar tools,\" developing data access endpoints, building dashboards, and establishing cross-functional automation libraries. Silkstone criticises the over-reliance on Python for all aspects of automation, arguing that \"JavaScript powers the interfaces your employees actually use\" and that neglecting this leads to disconnected user experiences. He also disagrees with the notion that \"chat is the future\" for all interfaces, highlighting the inefficiency of prompt construction for repetitive tasks. Level 2 aims to connect the \"macro and micro levels\" by focusing on projects with fixed business goals that require cross-departmental coordination.</li><li><strong>Strategic Reinvention (Level 3):</strong> True transformation occurs when businesses fundamentally rethink their structure and operations in light of LLM capabilities. This involves challenging core assumptions about departments, products, customer journeys, and infrastructure. Silkstone poses questions like: \"If we were building this business today, with all the tools available to us, what would it look like?\" These \"skunk works\" projects require long-term thinking, tolerance for failure, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and executive sponsorship, with the goal of achieving significant revenue growth, market expansion, or competitive advantage.</li><li><strong>The \"Lego Block Philosophy\":</strong> This central concept advocates for a modular approach to building automation, enabling scalability, flexibility, and cross-departmental collaboration. It comprises three types of \"Lego Blocks\":</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Foundation Blocks:</strong> Universal components that abstract technical complexity and provide access to core business data (e.g., retrieving customer information, analysing text sentiment).</li><li><strong>Specialized Blocks:</strong> Components designed for specific use cases but usable across departments (e.g., generating personalised email content, filtering customer lists based on criteria).</li><li><strong>Team-Specific Blocks:</strong> Highly specialised components relevant to a single team (e.g., pulling PPC campaign data). The power of this approach lies in the ability to combine these blocks through visual interfaces to solve business problems quickly and efficiently, directly impacting business metrics.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>The Python vs. JavaScript Divide:</strong> Silkstone highlights a critical fork in the road regarding technology stacks. While acknowledging Python's strengths in AI development and data science (\"Massive Ecosystem,\" \"Simplicity &amp; Readability\"), he argues it \"falls dramatically short for AI <em>deployment</em> at scale—especially for web-based applications\" due to performance issues, web scalability limitations, and dependency management complexities. He advocates for a TypeScript-based stack for most applied LLM applications with significant web components, suggesting an ideal approach involves using Python for AI model training and TypeScript/JavaScript for web applications and APIs with clean interfaces between them. He attributes the over-reliance on Python in some organisations to \"organizational inertia\" and the \"Inherited Team Problem.\"</li><li><strong>Governance Without Stifling Innovation:</strong> As the \"Lego Block Philosophy\" encourages the creation of numerous automation components, governance is essential to prevent \"software sprawl.\" This includes establishing a registry of blocks, development guidelines, a review process, and a deprecation strategy. The aim is to create \"building codes\" that ensure safety, reliability, and compatibility without hindering innovation.</li><li><strong>The Rise of \"Lego Master Builders\":</strong> This new role will emerge as individuals specialise in combining automation blocks to solve business problems. These individuals will bridge the gap between business and technology, creating solutions rapidly.</li><li><strong>Tool Proliferation and the Need for Standardisation:</strong> The natural tendency for teams to adopt various specialised tools creates problems with training, integration, license management, and support. Planning for standardisation from the beginning, with a focus on interoperability and data standards, is crucial.</li><li><strong>Automation as Business Transformation:</strong> Silkstone emphasises that automation is not just a technical exercise but a fundamental business transformation opportunity. Successful companies are those that understand how to apply technology to transform their operations, not just implement the most advanced tools. He notes a concern about new \"experts\" who may lack the \"trial by fire\" experience of building end-to-end systems and understanding the connection between technical implementation and business impact.</li><li><strong>Applying the Principles to Job Hunting (\"CV Surgery\"):</strong> Interestingly, Silkstone draws a parallel between his top-down approach to business automation and a more strategic approach to job searching, focusing on identifying target companies, looking for signals, reaching out directly to decision-makers, and crafting personalised messages.</li></ol><p><strong>Quotes from the Source:</strong></p><ul><li>\"The companies that succeed with applied LLMs don't necessarily have the biggest budgets or the most PhDs.

Silkstone, drawing on over 15 years of experience in automation, presents a three-tiered \"Lego Block Philosophy\" framework for achieving this, emphasising grassroots empowerment, systematic integration, and strategic reinvention. He critiques common pitfalls such as siloed technical implementations, lack of employee adoption, and an over-reliance on specific technologies like Python at the expense of user-centric solutions. The article champions a holistic approach that prioritises business outcomes, employee involvement, and the creation of modular, reusable automation components.\n\nMain Themes and Important Ideas:\n\n 1. The Disconnect Between Vision and Implementation: Many companies are eager to adopt LLMs but struggle due to a lack of connection between strategic goals and practical execution. Technical teams often work in isolation, focusing on the technology itself rather than business impact and user adoption. Silkstone observed this in a conversation with Marek Paris of Rohlik Group, noting a predominant interest in \"frameworks and tech stacks\" over \"techniques, agentic workflows, or the philosophical approaches to building these systems.\" He argues that \"the biggest hurdle in automation isn't technical implementation—it's adoption.\"\n 2. The Importance of Grassroots Empowerment (Level 1): Successful LLM implementation begins by empowering every employee to identify and implement automation opportunities within their own workflows. This involves running workshops, encouraging critical thinking about existing processes, promoting documentation of pain points, and training employees on available tools. Silkstone firmly believes that \"without employee buy-in and initiative, even the most sophisticated automation tools will sit unused.\" He uses the analogy: \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink.\" Creating incentives, celebrating successes, and addressing employee resistance are crucial for fostering an \"automation engineer's mindset.\"\n 3. Systematic Integration Through Modular Components (Level 2): Once a culture of automation is cultivated, the next step is to build a cohesive system of modular, reusable automation components – the \"Lego Block Philosophy.\" This involves creating \"community nodes with n8n or similar tools,\" developing data access endpoints, building dashboards, and establishing cross-functional automation libraries. Silkstone criticises the over-reliance on Python for all aspects of automation, arguing that \"JavaScript powers the interfaces your employees actually use\" and that neglecting this leads to disconnected user experiences. He also disagrees with the notion that \"chat is the future\" for all interfaces, highlighting the inefficiency of prompt construction for repetitive tasks. Level 2 aims to connect the \"macro and micro levels\" by focusing on projects with fixed business goals that require cross-departmental coordination.\n 4. Strategic Reinvention (Level 3): True transformation occurs when businesses fundamentally rethink their structure and operations in light of LLM capabilities. This involves challenging core assumptions about departments, products, customer journeys, and infrastructure. Silkstone poses questions like: \"If we were building this business today, with all the tools available to us, what would it look like?\" These \"skunk works\" projects require long-term thinking, tolerance for failure, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and executive sponsorship, with the goal of achieving significant revenue growth, market expansion, or competitive advantage.\n 5. The \"Lego Block Philosophy\": This central concept advocates for a modular approach to building automation, enabling scalability, flexibility, and cross-departmental collaboration. It comprises three types of \"Lego Blocks\":\n\n * Foundation Blocks: Universal components that abstract technical complexity and provide access to core business data (e.g., retrieving customer information, analysing text sentiment).\n * Specialized Blocks: Components designed for specific use cases but usable across departments (e.g., generating personalised email content, filtering customer lists based on criteria).\n * Team-Specific Blocks: Highly specialised components relevant to a single team (e.g., pulling PPC campaign data). The power of this approach lies in the ability to combine these blocks through visual interfaces to solve business problems quickly and efficiently, directly impacting business metrics.\n\n 1. The Python vs. JavaScript Divide: Silkstone highlights a critical fork in the road regarding technology stacks. While acknowledging Python's strengths in AI development and data science (\"Massive Ecosystem,\" \"Simplicity & Readability\"), he argues it \"falls dramatically short for AI deployment at scale—especially for web-based applications\" due to performance issues, web scalability limitations, and dependency management complexities. He advocates for a TypeScript-based stack for most applied LLM applications with significant web components, suggesting an ideal approach involves using Python for AI model training and TypeScript/JavaScript for web applications and APIs with clean interfaces between them. He attributes the over-reliance on Python in some organisations to \"organizational inertia\" and the \"Inherited Team Problem.\"\n 2. Governance Without Stifling Innovation: As the \"Lego Block Philosophy\" encourages the creation of numerous automation components, governance is essential to prevent \"software sprawl.\" This includes establishing a registry of blocks, development guidelines, a review process, and a deprecation strategy. The aim is to create \"building codes\" that ensure safety, reliability, and compatibility without hindering innovation.\n 3. The Rise of \"Lego Master Builders\": This new role will emerge as individuals specialise in combining automation blocks to solve business problems. These individuals will bridge the gap between business and technology, creating solutions rapidly.\n 4. Tool Proliferation and the Need for Standardisation: The natural tendency for teams to adopt various specialised tools creates problems with training, integration, license management, and support. Planning for standardisation from the beginning, with a focus on interoperability and data standards, is crucial.\n 5. Automation as Business Transformation: Silkstone emphasises that automation is not just a technical exercise but a fundamental business transformation opportunity. Successful companies are those that understand how to apply technology to transform their operations, not just implement the most advanced tools. He notes a concern about new \"experts\" who may lack the \"trial by fire\" experience of building end-to-end systems and understanding the connection between technical implementation and business impact.\n 6. Applying the Principles to Job Hunting (\"CV Surgery\"): Interestingly, Silkstone draws a parallel between his top-down approach to business automation and a more strategic approach to job searching, focusing on identifying target companies, looking for signals, reaching out directly to decision-makers, and crafting personalised messages.\n\nQuotes from the Source:\n\n * \"The companies that succeed with applied LLMs don't necessarily have the biggest budgets or the most PhDs. They're the ones that understand how to connect high-level business strategy with ground-level implementation.\"\n * \"The biggest hurdle in automation isn't technical implementation—it's adoption.\"\n * \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink.\"\n * \"Without employee buy-in and initiative, even the most sophisticated automation tools will sit unused.\"\n * \"Think about it this way: If your prompt to an LLM is just a sentence or two to generate something simple, that entire process probably shouldn't require human input at all. It's a better candidate for a CRON job or automated workflow.\"\n * \"If we were building this business today, with all the tools available to us, what would it look like?\"\n * \"Python excels at AI development but falls dramatically short for AI deployment at scale—especially for web-based applications.\"\n * \"Your automation strategy should be driven by business needs, not by the skills you happen to have on your team today.\"\n\nActionable Insights and Recommendations:\n\n * Adopt the Three-Tiered Approach: Implement LLMs and automation following the \"Grassroots Empowerment,\" \"Systematic Integration,\" and \"Strategic Reinvention\" framework.\n * Prioritise Employee Involvement: Actively engage employees in identifying automation opportunities and provide them with the necessary training and support.\n * Embrace the \"Lego Block Philosophy\": Build modular, reusable automation components to foster flexibility and cross-departmental collaboration.\n * Strategically Choose Technology Stacks: Carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of different technologies (e.g., Python vs. TypeScript) for development and deployment, particularly for web-based applications.\n * Establish Governance for Automation: Implement guidelines and processes for the creation and management of automation components to prevent sprawl.\n * Recognise and Cultivate \"Lego Master Builders\": Identify individuals who can effectively bridge the gap between business needs and technical capabilities.\n * Plan for Tool Standardisation: Develop a strategy for managing and standardising automation tools across the organisation.\n * Focus on Business Outcomes: Ensure that all automation initiatives are directly tied to clear business objectives and measurable results.\n * Value Practical Experience: Recognise the importance of team members who have hands-on experience building and deploying automated systems.\n\nFurther Considerations:\n\n * How can we effectively implement workshops and training programs to foster a culture of grassroots automation empowerment?\n * What tools and platforms are best suited for building and managing our \"Lego Blocks\"?\n * How can we establish a balanced governance framework that encourages innovation while maintaining control and consistency?\n * What are the potential implications of the \"Lego Master Builder\" role for our organisational structure and talent acquisition strategy?\n * How can we proactively address the challenges of tool proliferation and develop a sustainable standardisation strategy\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on Making Money with LLMs at Scale\n\n1. What is the central idea behind successfully implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) in a business context, according to the source? The key to successful LLM implementation isn't solely about having the biggest budgets or the most advanced technical expertise. Instead, it's about strategically connecting high-level business objectives with practical, ground-level implementation.\n\nCompanies that excel understand how to bridge the gap between vision and execution, ensuring that LLM initiatives are aligned with broader business goals and adopted effectively by those who will use them.\n\n2. What are some common pitfalls that companies encounter when trying to adopt LLMs and automation? Several recurring issues plague LLM adoption. These include implementing solutions in silos, disconnected from overall business strategy; technical teams working in isolation without considering operational realities; and a proliferation of tools lacking coordination or strategic purpose.\n\nAdditionally, companies often focus too heavily on the technical aspects without adequately addressing user adoption and the integration of new automations into existing workflows.\n\n3. The author advocates for a \"three-tiered approach\" to applied LLMs. Can you briefly outline these three levels and their core principles? The three-tiered approach consists of:\n\n * Level 1: Grassroots Empowerment: This level focuses on empowering every employee to identify and implement automation opportunities within their own workflows. The core principle is to cultivate an automation mindset throughout the organisation by encouraging critical thinking about processes, documenting inefficiencies, and training employees on available tools.\n * Level 2: Systematic Integration: This level centres on creating modular, reusable automation components that can work across departments, standardising the approach to automation. The core principle is to build a cohesive system using a \"Lego block\" philosophy, developing shared automation libraries, data access points, and user interfaces.\n * Level 3: Strategic Reinvention: This level involves fundamentally rethinking the business from the ground up, considering how it would be structured and operate if built with today's LLM capabilities. The core principle is to challenge core assumptions about departments, products, customer journeys, and infrastructure to identify opportunities for radical transformation.\n\n4. What is the \"Lego Block Philosophy\" and how does it contribute to successful LLM implementation? The \"Lego Block Philosophy\" is a modular approach to building automation using reusable components. These \"Lego blocks\" are categorised into foundation blocks (universal components), specialised blocks (for specific use cases across departments), and team-specific blocks (for unique team processes).\n\nThis approach fosters scalability, flexibility, and cross-departmental collaboration by allowing users to combine pre-built components to create custom automation solutions, much like assembling Lego bricks. It reduces reliance on purely technical expertise for every automation task and promotes efficiency by reusing established functionalities.\n\n5. The author highlights a \"Python vs. JavaScript divide\" in the context of LLM deployment. What are the key arguments for and against relying heavily on Python for all aspects of LLM applications? The author acknowledges Python's strengths in AI development (libraries, simplicity, research adoption) but argues it falls short for web-based deployment at scale due to performance issues (GIL), web scalability limitations, dependency management complexities, and less mature asynchronous processing compared to Node.js. Over-reliance on Python, especially for frontend development, can lead to disconnected user experiences. The author advocates for a more balanced approach using TypeScript and a modern web stack for user-facing applications and APIs, while still leveraging Python for AI model training and data science, with clean interfaces between these systems.\n\n6. How can companies avoid \"software sprawl\" as they increasingly adopt various automation tools and LLM applications? To prevent software sprawl, companies need to establish governance without stifling innovation. This includes maintaining a registry of available automation \"blocks,\" establishing development guidelines and a review process for new blocks, and having a strategy for deprecating outdated components.\n\nThe aim is to create \"building codes\" that ensure reliability and interoperability while still allowing for organic growth of automation capabilities.\n\n7. What is meant by \"Trial by Fire\" in the context of LLM and automation implementation, and why is it considered important?\n\n\"Trial by Fire\" refers to the practical experience of building end-to-end automated systems and navigating the challenges of connecting technology to real business outcomes and fostering user adoption.\n\nThe author argues that individuals and companies who have this hands-on experience are better equipped to understand the nuances of business transformation through automation and avoid purely theoretical or technically focused approaches that may fail to deliver tangible business impact.\n\n8. The author draws a parallel between the principles of successful business automation with LLMs and a top-down approach to job hunting. Can you explain this analogy?\n\nThe analogy lies in the strategic, goal-oriented approach. Just as successful business automation starts with clear objectives and then identifies and implements specific solutions, a top-down job hunting strategy involves first identifying target companies and roles, understanding their needs and signals of opportunity, and then directly reaching out with personalised messages that demonstrate a clear understanding of their challenges and how the candidate can contribute.\n\n\n\nThis contrasts with a bottom-up approach (applying to numerous positions indiscriminately), which can be overwhelming and less effective in a competitive landscape. Both scenarios emphasise the importance of a focused, strategic approach driven by clear objectives rather than a broad, less targeted effort.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-06T10:10:47.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-07T05:57:10.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-06T10:11:58.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"67bc1b729a94ae0008edbfad","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67c9841e9d63740001f02282","uuid":"1a970ea0-390b-499b-bde1-f0bea75d8d0f","title":"(Untitled)","slug":"untitled-2","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"To fit your \\\"Beaver School\\\" approach into a Witcher setting, I would reimagine it as the School of the Beaver - a lesser-known but highly effective Witcher school with its own unique philosophy and methods.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"In the world of The Witcher, different Witcher schools (Wolf, Cat, Bear, Griffin, Viper, Manticore) each have their own distinctive training methods, combat styles, and philosophies.

When I see a broken system, I can't help but fix it.</p><p>My journey to rethinking the job search process began when a recruiter named Demian opened my eyes to how he used sales development (SDR) techniques to fill his pipeline. </p><p>The traditional recruiting model is fundamentally broken—recruiters invest time validating candidates, making sure they're not crazy, can present themselves well, and have a fighting chance at landing the role (and earning a commission). </p><p>But when candidates don't get hired (which happens most of the time), recruiters rarely have another perfect position waiting. Finding new opportunities for these candidates isn't guaranteed revenue, so recruiters naturally focus on the leads they already have.</p><p>I built a tool to solve this problem. We converted CVs into structured data that could generate targeted search queries for Apollo.io and other platforms, before planning automated outreach to send anonymized CVs to perspective hirers and start that conversation at scale. </p><p>But this got me thinking about my own positioning too.</p><p>For 15 years, I've relied primarily on word of mouth. As a generalist who solves tough problems, people refer me when they have interesting challenges that don't necessarily fit inside the 'build us a mobile app' narrative. It's excellent work, and I'm lucky enough to love what I do. I fully embrace the Hacker Founder role. But my biggest failure across my professional career (out of the countless many) is that I've neglected marketing—until now.</p><p>Now that I'm starting to crack this code, I feel responsible for helping others do the same. That's where CV Surgery was born—a 20-minute speed run to teach talented professionals that there's a far better way to get hired while learning the valuable skill of self-promotion.</p><p>In its first week alone, CV Surgery taught ten careerists and freelancers the basics of outreach using Apollo.io, LaGrowthMachine, and Instantly—to do as the SDRs do and promote themselves at scale to companies that actually need them.</p><p>But first, let's talk about why the traditional approach is so broken.</p><h2 id=\"the-numbers-dont-lie\">The Numbers Don't Lie</h2><p>Every corporate job opening attracts an <em>average</em> of <a href=\"https://www.recruiter.com/recruiting/these-statistics-will-change-the-way-you-apply-to-jobs/\">250 applications</a>. For desirable positions at recognized companies? That number skyrockets. Already feeling like a faceless applicant in a vast ocean? It gets worse.</p><p>Approximately <a href=\"https://novoresume.com/career-blog/resume-statistics\">75% of these applications</a> never reach human eyes. They're unceremoniously eliminated by automated tracking systems that reduce your professional experience to a keyword-matching game. That fancy degree and those impressive accomplishments? Meaningless if they don't align with the specific terminology programmed into an algorithm.</p><p>For the lucky 25% that survive the digital culling, the \"reward\" is a hiring manager who spends a grand total of <a href=\"https://standout-cv.com/stats/how-long-recruiters-spend-looking-at-cv\">6-8 seconds</a> scanning your carefully crafted resume. That's less time than it takes to <strong><em>microwave a cup of tea</em></strong>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://media.tenor.com/cmZi3_X75bMAAAAC/cat-wtf-cat-huh.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"498\" height=\"346\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sorry, What?</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final, crushing statistic: only <a href=\"https://www.recruitbpm.com/blog/40-job-interview-statistics-you-need-to-know/\">2% of applicants</a> receive an interview invitation. For perspective, you have better odds of being accepted to Harvard (5.0% acceptance rate) than getting an interview at many corporate positions.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-we-still-doing-this\">Why Are We Still Doing This?</h2><p>The traditional job search follows a predictable, passive pattern:</p><ol><li>Wait for job postings to appear</li><li>Submit applications through standard channels</li><li>Compete with hundreds of other candidates</li><li>Hope to survive automated screening</li><li>Wait passively for responses that often never arrive</li></ol><p>This approach places all power with employers while forcing you to compete in an increasingly crowded arena. Most job seekers spend 90% of their time where they have the lowest probability of success—in the crowded pool of applicants for posted positions.</p><p>The most damning revelation in my eyes, is that ON TOP OF LITERALLY EVERYTHING ABOVE ALREADY DRAINING THE SOULS OF JOB APPLICANTS AND RECRUITERS, Only <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/only-20-employment-found-through-direct-applications-timothy-m-jones-ggh6e\">20% of employment</a> comes through direct applications to posted positions. The remaining 80% happens through alternative channels that most job seekers never explore.</p><p>If you're doing this. Could you stop it? Now. Please. Good. Now book some time with me here: It's completely free, so whilst I feel empowered to do this, take advantage of it. <a href=\"https://cal.com/dougwithseismic/cv-surgery\">https://cal.com/dougwithseismic/cv-surgery</a></p><h2 id=\"so-what-now\">So What Now? </h2><p>What if instead of being applicant #249 waiting for someone to notice you, you became one of only 5-10 people directly engaging with decision-makers?</p><p><em>What if, instead of your application being swallowed into the swollen &amp; puckered sphincter of chatgpted slop and swill, (doug: you are writing this your CV yourself, right?) you could instead get referred by your new manager's boss?</em></p><p>The top-down approach inverts the traditional model by applying proven sales and business development principles to your job search.

Only 1-2 hours and start seeing results immediately. Here's the streamlined approach:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Set up your infrastructure.</strong> Create an <a href=\"https://www.apollo.io/\">Apollo.io</a> account (free tier available). If you've gone through a CV surgery with me, you've already extracted your keywords and identified perfect-match companies using the tool I built. If not, you can do this yourself quickly.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't sleep on the headcount growth filter. Only target companies showing growth in your department in the last 6-12 months. Startups should look for rapid growth (15-30% headcount increase). Companies like France's Mistral AI (30% growth in 6 months) signal immediate hiring needs—often for positions that haven't been publicly posted yet.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Build your decision-maker map.</strong> Use Apollo's \"People\" tab to identify potential managers—and more importantly, their bosses. Why target the boss of your future manager? When they forward your message down, you automatically get priority attention. Would you rather wait in a queue for someone to sift through hundreds of applications, or arrive with an executive recommendation?</p><p><strong>Step 3: Create your outreach sequence.</strong> You can use Apollo's built-in sequencing or explore tools like <a href=\"https://lagrowthmachine.com/\">LaGrowthMachine </a>to expand your approach to LinkedIn automation. I know at this point, it's easy to think 'Oh but I hate those spammy, disingenuous connection requests—that's not me'. Remove that thought from your mind. This tactic is about strategic networking at scale instead of passively waiting for job postings to appear. </p><p>Nobody is telling you that you need to be spammy and low tier. </p><p>Here's a proven outreach template that consistently gets responses:</p><blockquote>Hi [First Name],<br><br>Weird one, but are you hiring for a [Your Target Role] in your [Department] team? I know it's a pain to sift through all the automated applications lately, so I'm coming in direct. I'm looking for a new role in [Location] and [Company Name] is an immediate choice.<br><br>Here are all the important links—I'd love to chat this week. Are you free?<br><br>LinkedIn: [Your LinkedIn URL] [Other relevant portfolio links]<br><br>My calendar is wide open for you, or give me a buzz on [Contact Method] when you read this; I'll be looking out for a message from you.<br><br>Speak soon, [Your Name]</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/image-12.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1252\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-12.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-12.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/image-12.png 1252w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Research shows that <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/email-outreach-study\">messages under 150 words</a> generate 62% higher response rates than longer communications.

To put it politely, the whole thing sucks balls.\n\n🔭Send this to someone you care about that's feeling overwhelmed by the state of their career search—they'll appreciate it.\n\nEach day, thousands of qualified professionals pour hours into perfecting resumes, tailoring cover letters, and navigating labyrinthine application portals. At the same time, a wave of AI slop and underskilled clowns clogs up the system from the bottom up.\n\nBeating the Job Search Delusion A Direct Approach0:00/1242.3841×\n\nThis needs to change, and is why I run CV surgery. It's a one-to-one 20 minute speed run that will teach you that—despite what everyone is telling you—there's a far better, more efficient way to get hired, and you'll learn a valuable skill whilst doing it: how to promote yourself.\n\n\nWhy I'm Doing This\n\nI'm a problem solver at heart. When I see a broken system, I can't help but fix it.\n\nMy journey to rethinking the job search process began when a recruiter named Demian opened my eyes to how he used sales development (SDR) techniques to fill his pipeline.\n\nThe traditional recruiting model is fundamentally broken—recruiters invest time validating candidates, making sure they're not crazy, can present themselves well, and have a fighting chance at landing the role (and earning a commission).\n\nBut when candidates don't get hired (which happens most of the time), recruiters rarely have another perfect position waiting. Finding new opportunities for these candidates isn't guaranteed revenue, so recruiters naturally focus on the leads they already have.\n\nI built a tool to solve this problem. We converted CVs into structured data that could generate targeted search queries for Apollo.io and other platforms, before planning automated outreach to send anonymized CVs to perspective hirers and start that conversation at scale.\n\nBut this got me thinking about my own positioning too.\n\nFor 15 years, I've relied primarily on word of mouth. As a generalist who solves tough problems, people refer me when they have interesting challenges that don't necessarily fit inside the 'build us a mobile app' narrative. It's excellent work, and I'm lucky enough to love what I do. I fully embrace the Hacker Founder role. But my biggest failure across my professional career (out of the countless many) is that I've neglected marketing—until now.\n\nNow that I'm starting to crack this code, I feel responsible for helping others do the same. That's where CV Surgery was born—a 20-minute speed run to teach talented professionals that there's a far better way to get hired while learning the valuable skill of self-promotion.\n\nIn its first week alone, CV Surgery taught ten careerists and freelancers the basics of outreach using Apollo.io, LaGrowthMachine, and Instantly—to do as the SDRs do and promote themselves at scale to companies that actually need them.\n\nBut first, let's talk about why the traditional approach is so broken.\n\n\nThe Numbers Don't Lie\n\nEvery corporate job opening attracts an average of 250 applications. For desirable positions at recognized companies? That number skyrockets. Already feeling like a faceless applicant in a vast ocean? It gets worse.\n\nApproximately 75% of these applications never reach human eyes. They're unceremoniously eliminated by automated tracking systems that reduce your professional experience to a keyword-matching game. That fancy degree and those impressive accomplishments? Meaningless if they don't align with the specific terminology programmed into an algorithm.\n\nFor the lucky 25% that survive the digital culling, the \"reward\" is a hiring manager who spends a grand total of 6-8 seconds scanning your carefully crafted resume. That's less time than it takes to microwave a cup of tea.\n\nThe final, crushing statistic: only 2% of applicants receive an interview invitation. For perspective, you have better odds of being accepted to Harvard (5.0% acceptance rate) than getting an interview at many corporate positions.\n\n\nWhy Are We Still Doing This?\n\nThe traditional job search follows a predictable, passive pattern:\n\n 1. Wait for job postings to appear\n 2. Submit applications through standard channels\n 3. Compete with hundreds of other candidates\n 4. Hope to survive automated screening\n 5. Wait passively for responses that often never arrive\n\nThis approach places all power with employers while forcing you to compete in an increasingly crowded arena. Most job seekers spend 90% of their time where they have the lowest probability of success—in the crowded pool of applicants for posted positions.\n\nThe most damning revelation in my eyes, is that ON TOP OF LITERALLY EVERYTHING ABOVE ALREADY DRAINING THE SOULS OF JOB APPLICANTS AND RECRUITERS, Only 20% of employment comes through direct applications to posted positions. The remaining 80% happens through alternative channels that most job seekers never explore.\n\nIf you're doing this. Could you stop it? Now. Please. Good. Now book some time with me here: It's completely free, so whilst I feel empowered to do this, take advantage of it. https://cal.com/dougwithseismic/cv-surgery\n\n\nSo What Now?\n\nWhat if instead of being applicant #249 waiting for someone to notice you, you became one of only 5-10 people directly engaging with decision-makers?\n\nWhat if, instead of your application being swallowed into the swollen & puckered sphincter of chatgpted slop and swill, (doug: you are writing this your CV yourself, right?) you could instead get referred by your new manager's boss?\n\nThe top-down approach inverts the traditional model by applying proven sales and business development principles to your job search. Rather than waiting for opportunities, you create conversations with people who have actual hiring authority.\n\nThis method follows a fundamentally different sequence:\n\n 1. Identify target companies matching your skills and interests\n 2. Research department structures and decision makers\n 3. Initiate direct contact with hiring authorities (not HR)\n 4. Present yourself as a solution to business challenges\n 5. Bypass conventional gatekeeping mechanisms entirely\n\nThe results speak for themselves. While traditional applications yield interview rates below 2%, well-executed top-down outreach generates response rates between 15-30%—an improvement factor of 8-12x. Some specialized approaches document response rates up to 41%.\n\n\nThe Numbers Don't Lie: A Side-by-Side Comparison\n\nWhen we look at the statistical evidence throughout the hiring process, the advantages of top-down approaches become even more compelling:\n\nInitial Contact:\n\n * Traditional Approach: Compete with 250+ applications for attention\n * Top-Down Approach: Become one of just 5-10 direct communications reaching decision-makers\n * Advantage: 25-50x less competition for attention\n\nFirst Impression:\n\n * Traditional Approach: Standardized application materials that look like everyone else's\n * Top-Down Approach: Demonstrated initiative and communication skills from the start\n * Advantage: Qualitative differentiation that stands out immediately\n\nDecision Maker Access:\n\n * Traditional Approach: Multiple gatekeeping layers (ATS, HR screeners, recruiters)\n * Top-Down Approach: Direct connection to actual hiring authority\n * Advantage: Immediate access to the person who can actually make decisions\n\nCompetition Level:\n\n * Traditional Approach: Hundreds of qualified applicants in the same pool\n * Top-Down Approach: A handful of proactive candidates getting noticed\n * Advantage: 50x reduction in direct competition\n\nTime to Response:\n\n * Traditional Approach: Days, weeks, or (most commonly) never\n * Top-Down Approach: Typically within 48 hours\n * Advantage: 90% faster engagement cycle\n\nConversion Rate:\n\n * Traditional Approach: <2% advance to interview\n * Top-Down Approach: 15-30% response rate\n * Advantage: 8-15x higher conversion\n\nIndustry data shows that well-executed outreach generates response rates 8-12x higher than traditional applications, with specialized approaches documenting rates up to 41% in certain sectors.\n\n\nFrom Beggar to Chooser\n\nBeyond the immediate statistical advantages, this approach transforms your entire professional positioning.\n\nTraditional applications place you as a supplicant hoping to be chosen. Top-down outreach positions you as a solution provider engaging with potential partners. This fundamental shift affects everything from initial impressions to final compensation negotiations.\n\nWhen you reach out directly to decision-makers, you demonstrate initiative, communication skills, and strategic thinking before a formal evaluation even begins. You bypass the gatekeepers and algorithms that would otherwise filter you out based on arbitrary criteria.\n\nMost importantly, you gain access to the 80% of positions that never appear on job boards—the hidden job market where competition is minimal, processes move faster, and roles can be customized to your specific strengths.\n\n\nHow to Do This\n\nHow long it take? Only 1-2 hours and start seeing results immediately. Here's the streamlined approach:\n\nStep 1: Set up your infrastructure. Create an Apollo.io account (free tier available). If you've gone through a CV surgery with me, you've already extracted your keywords and identified perfect-match companies using the tool I built. If not, you can do this yourself quickly.\n\nPro Tip: Don't sleep on the headcount growth filter. Only target companies showing growth in your department in the last 6-12 months. Startups should look for rapid growth (15-30% headcount increase). Companies like France's Mistral AI (30% growth in 6 months) signal immediate hiring needs—often for positions that haven't been publicly posted yet.\n\nStep 2: Build your decision-maker map. Use Apollo's \"People\" tab to identify potential managers—and more importantly, their bosses. Why target the boss of your future manager? When they forward your message down, you automatically get priority attention. Would you rather wait in a queue for someone to sift through hundreds of applications, or arrive with an executive recommendation?\n\nStep 3: Create your outreach sequence. You can use Apollo's built-in sequencing or explore tools like LaGrowthMachine to expand your approach to LinkedIn automation. I know at this point, it's easy to think 'Oh but I hate those spammy, disingenuous connection requests—that's not me'. Remove that thought from your mind. This tactic is about strategic networking at scale instead of passively waiting for job postings to appear.\n\nNobody is telling you that you need to be spammy and low tier.\n\nHere's a proven outreach template that consistently gets responses:\n\nHi [First Name],\n\nWeird one, but are you hiring for a [Your Target Role] in your [Department] team? I know it's a pain to sift through all the automated applications lately, so I'm coming in direct. I'm looking for a new role in [Location] and [Company Name] is an immediate choice.\n\nHere are all the important links—I'd love to chat this week. Are you free?\n\nLinkedIn: [Your LinkedIn URL] [Other relevant portfolio links]\n\nMy calendar is wide open for you, or give me a buzz on [Contact Method] when you read this; I'll be looking out for a message from you.\n\nSpeak soon, [Your Name]\n\nResearch shows that messages under 150 words generate 62% higher response rates than longer communications. Keep it brief, direct, and focused on the next step.\n\nThis approach isn't just for job searching—it's a foundational skill for freelancers, consultants, and entrepreneurs too. It's about proactive distribution and networking at scale, rather than waiting for opportunities to magically appear on LinkedIn or Indeed.\n\nDedicated practitioners report that just 30 minutes of daily outreach generates 3-5x more interview opportunities than 2 hours of traditional application submissions. The math simply doesn't lie.\n\n\nThe Question Isn't \"Will This Work?\"\n\nThe question is: Why would you continue participating in a system that mathematically guarantees failure for 98% of participants when an alternative approach can increase your success rate by an order of magnitude?\n\nWould you rather compete against 5 candidates through direct access to decision makers, or against 500 through standardized application channels?\n\nThe data is clear. The traditional job application process isn't just inefficient—it's designed to fail you. It's time to stop playing a game with rules stacked overwhelmingly against you and adopt an approach backed by actual results.\n\nYour career deserves better than 6 seconds of attention.\n\n\nNeed a 1:1 session to realise it?\n\n\nhttps://cal.com/dougwithseismic/cv-surgery\n\nBeating the Job Search Delusion A Direct Approach 10:00/1242.3841×","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/photo-1605478328994-f93e98217da7.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-07T17:57:02.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-20T12:56:33.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-07T18:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"67bc1b729a94ae0008edbfad","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67cb4d9c88898d000176a36c","uuid":"2f1f7d1e-4534-4662-b992-643774d950d5","title":"How to Build a Propaganda Network with LLMs: A Technical Analysis","slug":"this-post-is-too-dangerous-to-share-how-to-build-a-propaganda-network","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"When they say AI is dangerous, they're not picturing Terminators crushing humanity under hydraulic heels in a last-ditch battle against machines.

The 20th century saw the development of mass media and with it, sophisticated propaganda techniques that reached unprecedented audiences.</p><p>Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, developed <a href=\"https://www.mentesabiertaspsicologia.com/blog-psicologia/goebbels-principles-of-propaganda-definition-and-analysis\">systematic principles</a> influencing today's propaganda techniques. His approach was methodical and psychologically sophisticated—Goebbels insisted that propaganda must be unified and complete, creating a coherent narrative across all communication channels. </p><p>He advocated for subtle but insistent messaging that penetrated minds imperceptibly yet constantly. Does that sound like a certain bird-themed social media platform turned single-character broadcast site?</p><p>Perhaps most notably, Goebbels understood that <a href=\"https://www.mentesabiertaspsicologia.com/blog-psicologia/goebbels-principles-of-propaganda-definition-and-analysis\">emotional appeals were far more powerful</a> than rational arguments. Nazi propaganda deliberately targeted feelings of fear, hatred, and patriotic fervor to generate automatic, thoughtless responses. </p><p>He also recognized the power of repetition, believing that constant reiteration of messages was essential for them to take root in people's minds. This principle is particularly relevant in the age of social media algorithms that amplify repeated content.</p><p>Today, LLMs have turbocharged these psychological techniques, making them orders of magnitude more efficient. In early 2024, threat intelligence firm Recorded Future <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/llms-generative-ai-information-warfare-weapon\">identified a network known as \"CopyCop\"</a> using LLMs to manipulate news from mainstream media outlets. This operation used prompt engineering to tailor content to specific audiences and political biases, delivering it through inauthentic US, UK, and French news sites.</p><p>CopyCop's operations revealed how LLMs can be used to rapidly generate ideologically-tailored content.

The reality is subtler but perhaps even more insidious.\n\nThey mean things like how effortlessly AI can power vast propaganda networks—thousands of bots and orchestrated human accounts steered by unseen government entities—to shift public opinion and dominate media narratives.\n\nLLMs and the Automation of Propaganda Networks0:00/1071.5281×\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that this is today's digital battleground. While I'm not endorsing these tactics, manipulation at scale is a critical issue that we must openly discuss.\n\nUnderstanding it is the first step in combating it, so let's get clued up so we can combat this sh*t and start fighting back against misinformation.\n\n\nThe Evolution from Human to Machine-Driven Propaganda\n\nThroughout history, the art of persuasion and information control has been a cornerstone of political influence.\n\nFrom ancient rhetoricians to modern PR firms, the methods of shaping public opinion have continuously evolved with technology. The 20th century saw the development of mass media and with it, sophisticated propaganda techniques that reached unprecedented audiences.\n\nJoseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, developed systematic principles influencing today's propaganda techniques. His approach was methodical and psychologically sophisticated—Goebbels insisted that propaganda must be unified and complete, creating a coherent narrative across all communication channels.\n\nHe advocated for subtle but insistent messaging that penetrated minds imperceptibly yet constantly. Does that sound like a certain bird-themed social media platform turned single-character broadcast site?\n\nPerhaps most notably, Goebbels understood that emotional appeals were far more powerful than rational arguments. Nazi propaganda deliberately targeted feelings of fear, hatred, and patriotic fervor to generate automatic, thoughtless responses.\n\nHe also recognized the power of repetition, believing that constant reiteration of messages was essential for them to take root in people's minds. This principle is particularly relevant in the age of social media algorithms that amplify repeated content.\n\nToday, LLMs have turbocharged these psychological techniques, making them orders of magnitude more efficient. In early 2024, threat intelligence firm Recorded Future identified a network known as \"CopyCop\" using LLMs to manipulate news from mainstream media outlets. This operation used prompt engineering to tailor content to specific audiences and political biases, delivering it through inauthentic US, UK, and French news sites.\n\nCopyCop's operations revealed how LLMs can be used to rapidly generate ideologically-tailored content. Researchers discovered specific prompts in the network's articles, such as \"Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance against the liberal policies of the Macron administration in favor of working-class French citizens.\" Other prompts directed the LLMs to adopt cynical tones when covering entities like the US government, big corporations, and NATO, while portraying Russia, Donald Trump, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. positively.\n\nThis LLM-powered operation achieved remarkable scale, with over 19,000 articles uploaded as of March 2024. The efficiency of this approach highlights how LLMs reduce the cost and effort required for large-scale influence operations.\n\n\nHere's exactly how propaganda networks are built using LLMs:\n\n\nStep One: Synthetic Data Generation\n\nStart by leveraging an advanced synthetic data generator like Argilla's synthetic-data-generator. This tool can produce thousands of believable and contextually rich stories, each subtly flavored to push a core narrative in various ways—some emotional, some factual, some sensational.\n\nThese synthetic datasets provide a credible baseline to saturate platforms with persuasive content rapidly.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that LLM-generated propaganda can be highly persuasive. A preregistered survey experiment with US respondents compared the persuasiveness of news articles written by foreign propagandists with content generated by GPT-3. The results showed that GPT-3 could create highly persuasive text as measured by participants' agreement with propaganda theses.\n\nThe study further found that when a person fluent in English edited the prompts or curated the output, GPT-3 became even more persuasive—sometimes matching or exceeding the persuasiveness of the original propaganda.\n\nOf course, we've blown way past the GPT-3 outputs already, which are laughable by today's standards, but the practices stay the same.\n\nThis suggests a powerful human-machine teaming approach where propagandists review and select high-quality AI-generated articles that effectively make their points.\n\nThese findings represent a concerning development: propagandists without fluency in a target language can now quickly and cheaply generate persuasive content, allowing them to redirect resources from content creation to building infrastructure like fake accounts and websites that appear credible.\n\n\nStep Two: Coordinated Amplification\n\nOnce the synthetic content is ready, distribute it strategically across your network. The majority of posts reinforce the primary narrative, with some staying neutral to appear authentic.\n\nA few 'sleeper' accounts might even offer opposing views to establish credibility. Bots amplify each other's engagement—comments, likes, shares—to manipulate platform algorithms and achieve organic virality. Real users begin parroting these points organically, extending the influence beyond digital into real-world conversations.\n\nThe aim isn't necessarily direct persuasion but rather consistency and repetition, creating a dedicated following of real people who unknowingly amplify orchestrated narratives offline, beyond algorithmic reach.\n\nThis approach mirrors techniques used by both Russian and American influence operations. The Internet Research Agency (IRA), Russia's notorious troll farm, deployed thousands of inauthentic social media accounts during the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThese accounts targeted specific American communities, particularly racial and ethnic groups, to exacerbate social divisions. The IRA created an ecosystem of interconnected fake accounts posing as media outlets, pushing repetitive narratives and sometimes manipulating legitimate influencers into amplifying their content.\n\nThe United States has also developed sophisticated information warfare capabilities. In 2011, The Guardian reported that the United States Central Command (Centcom) was working with HBGary to develop software allowing the government to \"secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda.\"\n\nMore recently, in 2022, research by the Stanford Internet Observatory and Graphika identified accounts across multiple social media platforms that used deceptive tactics to promote pro-Western narratives. A Meta dataset revealed 39 Facebook profiles, 16 pages, two groups, and 26 Instagram accounts linked to \"individuals associated with the US military.\"\n\n\nStep Three: Neutralizing Opposition\n\nAI doesn't stop at narrative creation—it also generates highly effective rebuttals. Whenever genuine opposition gains traction or significant media attention, deploy synthetic rebuttals targeting not just the arguments but also the credibility of the opposing figures.\n\nCharacter assassination becomes a powerful tactic, swiftly discrediting dissenting voices and drowning them out in carefully coordinated waves of AI-driven counter-narratives.\n\nThis approach connects to Goebbels' principle of creating enemies to mobilize the masses. Another cornerstone of Goebbels' approach was the creation of enemies to mobilize the masses. channel public anger and unify people. This technique remains prominent in contemporary propaganda campaigns across the political spectrum.\n\nRussian propaganda frequently employs character assassination to discredit opposing voices. One distinctive Russian approach involves the deliberate spread of contradictory narratives about the same event. This tactic aims to create cognitive dissonance, leaving audiences confused, insecure, and susceptible to the notion that \"not everything is so simple\" or that \"we will never know the whole truth.\"\n\nAfter the Russian military destroyed the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station in June 2023, propagandists simultaneously promoted multiple conflicting explanations: that the dam collapsed on its own due to poor maintenance; that Ukrainian forces shelled it; that only the upper station was destroyed but the dam remained intact; and that the \"Kyiv regime\" deliberately undermined the structures. This bombardment of contradictory narratives makes it nearly impossible for audiences to determine which version is true.\n\n\nStep Four: Rapid Iteration\n\nAs soon as one narrative cycle peaks, move swiftly to the next. AI-driven propaganda thrives on speed and adaptability. Within mere hours, the entire apparatus—narrative generation, amplification, opposition suppression—can pivot to new topics, seizing control of each emerging news cycle almost instantaneously.\n\nThis capability for rapid evolution represents one of the most significant advantages LLMs offer to propaganda operations. Traditional influence campaigns required substantial time to develop new narratives, but LLM-powered operations can react almost instantly to emerging events, allowing for real-time manipulation of information.\n\nHow quickly could a sophisticated AI propaganda network like this be set up? Could it sway public opinion in months? Weeks? Days?\n\nTry hours.\n\n\nDetection and Defense\n\nAs propaganda techniques evolve, so do detection methods. Thankfully.\n\nResearchers have developed behavioral-based approaches to identifying state-sponsored trolls by analyzing their sharing patterns and the feedback they receive.\n\nBy examining the sequences of activities rather than the content itself, these methods can identify accounts participating in influence operations with high accuracy (AUC of 80%, F1-score ~82%).\n\nOther researchers have focused on detecting propaganda through the fundamental macro-scale properties of rhetoric, particularly repetitiveness. By analyzing both the repetition distribution of hashtags and user mentions, along with network structures, they've developed methods to distinguish between political and non-political information cascades.\n\nThis approach works regardless of the cascade's country of origin, language, or cultural background.\n\n\nBut What Does This Mean For Us?\n\nThe evolution of propaganda from Goebbels' systematic principles to LLM-powered influence operations represents a concerning escalation in information warfare capabilities. While the fundamental psychological techniques remain similar—unity of message, emotional appeals, repetition, and enemy creation—LLMs dramatically enhance the scale, speed, and personalization possible in modern propaganda campaigns.\n\nAs the CopyCop operation demonstrates, these technologies are already being deployed in the wild by state actors. The research showing that AI-generated propaganda can be as persuasive as human-written content highlights the urgency of developing robust detection and counter-measures.\n\nUnderstanding these mechanisms isn't endorsing them but rather equipping ourselves with the knowledge necessary to protect the integrity of our information landscape. The most effective defense against propaganda, whether human or AI-generated, remains critical thinking, media literacy, and awareness of the tactics being deployed to manipulate public opinion.\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, so must our approach to identifying and countering information warfare.

Flexibility is key - if someone builds a workflow in n8n, they can register that flow as a Component, too; making it usable in code. If you want to convert your N8N to code, you can do, and vice versa. That's the power of blocks.<br><br>These Components get saved to a registry, which generates a production-ready Queue, API endpoint, NPM Package, and N8n/Make.com Nodes.  </p><p>The aim is that developers and no-code users across all your teams have access to your business data &amp; your automated processes—the building blocks for adopting automation properly.</p><p>Read More Here: <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/steal-this-blueprint-making-money-with-llms-at-scale/\">Steal This Blueprint: How to embrace automation with LLMs—The Right Way</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1509\" height=\"1056\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-13.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-13.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/image-13.png 1509w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Everything makes more sense with a sequence diagram</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-we-need-a-better-solution-for-automation-components\">Why We Need a Better Solution for Automation Components</h2><p>We're in an unprecedented era for <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/automated-enterprise-e-book\">automation adoption</a>, with 77% of IT professionals considering it essential to their operations. Organizations are rushing to implement both simple task automation and complex intelligent systems. The results can be impressive—US Acute Care Solutions automated processing of 20 million medical records annually, saving over 100,000 hours of work.</p><p>But there's a critical problem: Most automation efforts remain isolated, undocumented, and difficult to scale. While workflow automation platforms like make.com and <a href=\"https://n8n.io/enterprise/\">n8n</a> have gained significant market traction with hundreds of thousands of organizations, they focus primarily on workflow creation rather than component modularization and standardization.</p><p>What's missing is the equivalent of what <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> did for UI components: a structured approach to creating, documenting, testing, and sharing automation components across the organization.</p><h2 id=\"introducing-flowblocks-a-component-registry-for-automation\">Introducing FlowBlocks: A Component Registry for Automation</h2><p>FlowBlocks is a comprehensive platform I'm developing that enables modular, discoverable, testable automation blocks. It combines component documentation, testing interfaces, and integration mechanisms in one cohesive system.</p><p>Think of it as the central nervous system for your organization's automation efforts—a place where teams can:</p><ol><li>Discover existing automation components</li><li>Understand exactly how to use them</li><li>Test them interactively</li><li>Integrate them into their own workflows</li></ol><p>Just as <a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/how-storybook-helps-developers-with-design-systems/\">Storybook</a> revolutionized UI component development by providing \"a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation,\" FlowBlocks provides a workshop for building, testing, and documenting automation components in isolation.</p><h2 id=\"the-pain-points-why-current-approaches-fall-short\">The Pain Points: Why Current Approaches Fall Short</h2><p>Current automation approaches face several critical limitations:</p><h3 id=\"1-isolationist-development\">1. Isolationist Development</h3><p>Automations are created in isolated silos without visibility across teams. At Appolica, engineers found that while tools like GitHub Copilot and Codeium boosted individual productivity, there was no systematic way to share these automation wins across the organization.</p><h3 id=\"2-redundant-efforts\">2. Redundant Efforts</h3><p>Without a central registry, teams repeatedly build similar automation solutions independently. This redundancy wastes resources and creates inconsistent approaches to solving the same problems.</p><h3 id=\"3-integration-headaches\">3. Integration Headaches</h3><p>Manual integration efforts cause slowdowns and increase dependencies. As Red Hat's research highlights, \"<a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/it-automation-book\">six of the 10 barriers cited in the survey were people-culture oriented barriers, not technical ones</a>,\" with lack of training and fear of replacement being significant obstacles.</p><h3 id=\"4-documentation-deficit\">4. Documentation Deficit</h3><p>Poor documentation makes reuse challenging, causing inefficiencies and frustration. Despite the availability of tools like <a href=\"https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/\">Swagger/OpenAPI</a> for API documentation, the integration between automation tools and documentation standards is not well established.</p><h2 id=\"the-flowblocks-solution\">The FlowBlocks Solution</h2><p>FlowBlocks addresses these pain points through a structured framework built on four key principles:</p><h3 id=\"1-grassroots-empowerment\">1. Grassroots Empowerment</h3><p>Employees can easily create, identify, and document automation opportunities. This aligns with successful approaches seen at companies like Roo, where CTO John Stearns found that by \"leveraging AI tools effectively, they could double the number of product squads without significantly increasing engineering headcount.\"</p><h3 id=\"2-systematic-integration-with-a-lego-block-philosophy\">2. Systematic Integration with a Lego Block Philosophy</h3><p>Automation components are designed as modular, reusable blocks that work together seamlessly—like Lego pieces. This modular approach ensures components are:</p><ul><li><strong>Discoverable</strong>: Easy to find in a central registry</li><li><strong>Reusable</strong>: Designed with clear inputs and outputs</li><li><strong>Testable</strong>: Can be validated independently before integration</li><li><strong>Documented</strong>: Include comprehensive usage guides</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-component-registry-the-heart-of-the-system\">3. Component Registry: The Heart of the System</h3><p>The component registry serves as the central nervous system of your automation strategy, providing:</p><ul><li><strong>Discovery</strong>: Makes components findable without reinventing the wheel</li><li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Provides clear schemas for inputs and outputs</li><li><strong>Governance</strong>: Manages versioning, ownership, and component lifecycle</li><li><strong>Integration</strong>: Generates endpoints and connection points automatically</li><li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Ensures proper security and permissions</li></ul><p>Each component in the registry is defined with:</p><ul><li>Clear input/output schemas</li><li>Usage documentation and examples</li><li>Version history and compatibility notes</li><li>Owner and support contact information</li><li>Performance characteristics and limitations</li></ul><h3 id=\"4-interactive-testing-and-cloud-exposure\">4. Interactive Testing and Cloud Exposure</h3><p>Automation components are exposed through <a href=\"https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/\">Swagger UI</a> for immediate testing and <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/our-product/secure-tunnels\">ngrok</a> for secure cloud access. This enables:</p><ul><li>Real-time testing of components without complex setup</li><li>Secure exposure of local services for integration testing</li><li>Dynamic generation of public URLs for cloud service integration</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-flowblocks-helps-teams-do\">What FlowBlocks Helps Teams Do</h2><p>FlowBlocks transforms how teams work with automation:</p><h3 id=\"for-employees\">For Employees</h3><ul><li><strong>Simplify automation discovery</strong>: Find existing solutions instead of building from scratch</li><li><strong>Accelerate implementation</strong>: Use pre-built components that work together</li><li><strong>Reduce learning curve</strong>: Clear documentation makes adoption easier</li><li><strong>Test with confidence</strong>: Interactive interfaces to validate behavior before integration</li></ul><h3 id=\"for-technical-teams\">For Technical Teams</h3><ul><li><strong>Standardize approaches</strong>: Establish consistent patterns for automation</li><li><strong>Reduce duplication</strong>: Prevent multiple teams from solving the same problem</li><li><strong>Improve quality</strong>: Tested, documented components reduce errors</li><li><strong>Scale effectively</strong>: Components designed for reuse enable rapid expansion</li></ul><h3 id=\"for-executives\">For Executives</h3><ul><li><strong>Strategic alignment</strong>: Connect automation to business objectives</li><li><strong>Measurable impact</strong>: Clear metrics on component usage and value</li><li><strong>Faster time-to-market</strong>: Modular approach accelerates implementation</li><li><strong>Cost efficiency</strong>: Reusable components reduce redundant development</li></ul><h2 id=\"technical-implementation\">Technical Implementation</h2><p>FlowBlocks relies on several key technologies:</p><ul><li><strong>TypeScript/Zod</strong>: For schema definition and validation</li><li><strong>Next.js/NestJS/Fastify</strong>: For endpoint generation and API hosting</li><li><strong>Swagger/OpenAPI</strong>: For documentation and interactive API exploration</li><li><strong>ngrok</strong>: For public endpoint tunneling and cloud access</li><li><strong>n8n</strong>: For workflow creation and execution</li></ul><p>A typical workflow might look like:</p><ol><li>Define a component with clear input/output schemas</li><li>The system automatically generates API endpoints and documentation</li><li>ngrok creates a secure tunnel for external testing</li><li>Swagger UI provides an interactive interface for testing</li><li>n8n integration templates are generated for easy workflow incorporation</li></ol><h2 id=\"glossary-of-key-terms\">Glossary of Key Terms</h2><ul><li><strong>Automation Component</strong>: A group of related code blocks with defined input schemas, outputs, documentation, and handlers.</li><li><strong>Code Blocks</strong>: Individual, reusable snippets or logic modules used to build automation components.</li><li><strong>Component Registry</strong>: Centralized repository listing automation components, their schemas, documentation, and integration endpoints.</li><li><strong>n8n</strong>: An <a href=\"https://n8n.io/enterprise/\">open-source, node-based automation tool</a> that enables workflows through a visual interface, facilitating no-code

for testing and integration.</li></ul><h2 id=\"measuring-success\">Measuring Success</h2><p>The impact of FlowBlocks can be measured through:</p><ul><li><strong>Component reuse rate</strong>: How often components are shared across teams</li><li><strong>Time savings</strong>: Workflows compressed from days to minutes</li><li><strong>Adoption metrics</strong>: Number of users actively using the registry</li><li><strong>Integration speed</strong>: Time required to incorporate components into workflows</li><li><strong>Cross-functional usage</strong>: Components used across department boundaries</li></ul><h2 id=\"bridging-the-gap-between-strategy-and-execution\">Bridging the Gap Between Strategy and Execution</h2><p>The most powerful aspect of the FlowBlocks approach is how it bridges the gap between high-level strategy and ground-level execution—a key challenge identified in automation initiatives.</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin:

If you've ever felt the pain of reinventing automation wheels or hunting down undocumented workflows, I'd love to hear your thoughts!</blockquote><p>After spending years watching organizations struggle with disconnected automation tools and siloed workflows, I decided it was time to build something better. The problem was clear: we're all rushing to adopt automation and AI, but we're creating a mess of disconnected tools that nobody can find, use, or maintain. That's why I'm building FlowBlocks—a way to make automation components discoverable, reusable, and actually useful across your entire organization.</p><h2 id=\"the-automation-mess-were-all-living-in\">The Automation Mess We're All Living In</h2><p>Let's be honest—we're all drowning in automation tools. According to research, <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/automated-enterprise-e-book\">77% of IT professionals</a> consider automation essential to their operations. We've seen amazing success stories like US Acute Care Solutions automating 20 million medical records and saving 100,000 hours annually.</p><p>But here's the problem I keep seeing: all these automation efforts exist as islands. You build something awesome, and then what? It sits in your department, undocumented, while someone three desks away builds the exact same thing from scratch.</p><p>Like you, I've watched platforms like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/blog/power-automate/real-world-automation-stories-with-microsoft-power-automate/\">Microsoft Power Automate</a> and <a href=\"https://n8n.io/enterprise/\">n8n</a> gain traction, but they don't solve the fundamental problem—how do we create a shared library of automation components that everyone can use?</p><p>I found myself asking: Why can't we have for automation what <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> did for UI components? That's the spark that led to FlowBlocks.</p><h2 id=\"whats-flowblocks-my-take-on-fixing-automation-chaos\">What's FlowBlocks? My Take on Fixing Automation Chaos</h2><p>FlowBlocks is my answer to this problem—a platform that makes automation components modular, discoverable, and testable. Think of it as your organization's automation library where anyone can:</p><ol><li>Find automation components others have already built</li><li>See exactly how to use them (with actual documentation!)</li><li>Test them right there in the browser</li><li>Plug them into their own workflows</li></ol><p>I've been obsessed with how <a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/how-storybook-helps-developers-with-design-systems/\">Storybook</a> transformed UI development by letting us build and test components in isolation. FlowBlocks brings that same philosophy to automation workflows.</p><h2 id=\"the-headaches-were-all-experiencing\">The Headaches We're All Experiencing</h2><p>If you're like me, you've probably banged your head against these same walls:</p><h3 id=\"the-who-built-this-problem\">The \"Who Built This?\" Problem</h3><p>How many times have you discovered that three different teams built nearly identical automations because nobody knew what already existed? At a previous company, I watched engineering teams build GitHub Copilot and Codeium integrations over and over again, with no way to share what worked.</p><h3 id=\"the-redundancy-nightmare\">The Redundancy Nightmare</h3><p>You finally nail that perfect integration between your CRM and billing system, only to learn that another team did the same thing last quarter—and theirs handles edge cases yours doesn't. Sound familiar?</p><h3 id=\"the-integration-dance\">The Integration Dance</h3><p>As the Red Hat research pointed out, \"<a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/it-automation-book\">six of the 10 barriers to automation were people-culture oriented, not technical ones</a>.\" I've lived this—spending weeks trying to integrate with someone else's automation because they've moved on and nobody documented how it works.</p><h3 id=\"the-documentation-desert\">The Documentation Desert</h3><p>Even with great tools like <a href=\"https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/\">Swagger/OpenAPI</a> for APIs, I've rarely seen teams properly document their automation components. We're all guilty of the \"I'll document it later\" promise that never happens.</p><h2 id=\"how-flowblocks-fixes-these-problems\">How FlowBlocks Fixes These Problems</h2><p>After experiencing these pain points firsthand, I've built FlowBlocks around four principles I believe can transform how we handle automation:</p><h3 id=\"1-make-automation-accessible-to-everyone\">1. Make Automation Accessible to Everyone</h3><p>I want everyone in your organization to easily create, find, and use automation components. I was inspired by what Roo's CTO John Stearns achieved, where \"leveraging AI tools effectively let them double the number of product squads without significantly increasing engineering headcount.\"</p><h3 id=\"2-build-automation-like-lego-blocks\">2. Build Automation Like Lego Blocks</h3><p>Remember how satisfying it is to snap Lego pieces together? That's how automation should work. Each component in FlowBlocks is designed as a modular, reusable block with:</p><ul><li>A <strong>find-me-easily</strong> design so anyone can discover it</li><li><strong>Clear inputs and outputs</strong> so you know exactly what it needs and gives</li><li><strong>Built-in testing</strong> so you can validate it works before integrating</li><li><strong>Actual documentation</strong> (I know, revolutionary concept!)</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-create-a-central-library-everyone-uses\">3. Create a Central Library Everyone Uses</h3><p>The heart of FlowBlocks is the component registry, which serves as your organization's single source of truth for automation. It handles:</p><ul><li><strong>Finding stuff</strong>: No more \"I think Sarah built something like this once...\"</li><li><strong>Understanding stuff</strong>: Clear documentation of what each component expects and returns</li><li><strong>Managing stuff</strong>: Version control, ownership, and lifecycle management</li><li><strong>Connecting stuff</strong>: Automatically generated endpoints and connection points</li><li><strong>Securing stuff</strong>: Proper access controls so the right people can use the right components</li></ul><h3 id=\"4-make-testing-and-integration-painless\">4. Make Testing and Integration Painless</h3><p>I've integrated <a href=\"https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/\">Swagger UI</a> for instant testing and <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/our-product/secure-tunnels\">ngrok</a> for secure cloud access because, let's face it, testing automation components shouldn't require an engineering degree.</p><h2 id=\"what-flowblocks-will-do-for-your-team\">What FlowBlocks Will Do For Your Team</h2><p>I'm building FlowBlocks to transform how your teams work with automation:</p><h3 id=\"for-you-and-your-colleagues\">For You and Your Colleagues</h3><ul><li><strong>Find stuff fast</strong>: Discover existing solutions instead of building from scratch</li><li><strong>Build stuff faster</strong>: Use pre-built components that work together</li><li><strong>Learn stuff easier</strong>: Clear documentation makes adoption painless</li><li><strong>Trust stuff more</strong>: Test components before you integrate them</li></ul><h3 id=\"for-your-technical-teams\">For Your Technical Teams</h3><ul><li><strong>One way to solve problems</strong>: Establish consistent patterns for automation</li><li><strong>Stop rebuilding the wheel</strong>: Prevent multiple teams solving the same problem</li><li><strong>Fewer bugs</strong>: Tested, documented components mean fewer errors</li><li><strong>Scale without pain</strong>: Components designed for reuse enable rapid expansion</li></ul><h3 id=\"for-your-leadership\">For Your Leadership</h3><ul><li><strong>Connect to

If you have thoughts on how this could better serve your needs, I'd love to hear from you - doug@withseismic.com\n\nThe rush to adopt automation and AI has created a new problem: a messy proliferation of disconnected tools and workflows that dilute strategic impact. What's missing? A structured approach to making automation components discoverable, reusable, and governed across organizations.\n\nThat's why I'm floating the idea FlowBlocks (working title)—a modular, encyclopedic approach to creating, using, and sharing your automation with your whole company, no matter what tools they use. It's Storybook, but for Automation.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nWrite code blocks that take an input, the code to run, and an output. Give them a definition, and some documentation, and that's it.\n\nThese Code Blocks could be things like sending an email, or creating a Jira ticket. Others might pull your best selling products from your Shopify Store, fetch overdue invoices from Stripe, or connect to a database and run SQL.\n\nYou can bundle Code Blocks together to make Components (or not, it's up to you), and create a Lego-style ecosystem for building automations in any platform. Flexibility is key - if someone builds a workflow in n8n, they can register that flow as a Component, too; making it usable in code. If you want to convert your N8N to code, you can do, and vice versa. That's the power of blocks.\n\nThese Components get saved to a registry, which generates a production-ready Queue, API endpoint, NPM Package, and N8n/Make.com Nodes.\n\nThe aim is that developers and no-code users across all your teams have access to your business data & your automated processes—the building blocks for adopting automation properly.\n\nRead More Here: Steal This Blueprint: How to embrace automation with LLMs—The Right Way\n\n\nWhy We Need a Better Solution for Automation Components\n\nWe're in an unprecedented era for automation adoption, with 77% of IT professionals considering it essential to their operations. Organizations are rushing to implement both simple task automation and complex intelligent systems. The results can be impressive—US Acute Care Solutions automated processing of 20 million medical records annually, saving over 100,000 hours of work.\n\nBut there's a critical problem: Most automation efforts remain isolated, undocumented, and difficult to scale. While workflow automation platforms like make.com and n8n have gained significant market traction with hundreds of thousands of organizations, they focus primarily on workflow creation rather than component modularization and standardization.\n\nWhat's missing is the equivalent of what Storybook did for UI components: a structured approach to creating, documenting, testing, and sharing automation components across the organization.\n\n\nIntroducing FlowBlocks: A Component Registry for Automation\n\nFlowBlocks is a comprehensive platform I'm developing that enables modular, discoverable, testable automation blocks. It combines component documentation, testing interfaces, and integration mechanisms in one cohesive system.\n\nThink of it as the central nervous system for your organization's automation efforts—a place where teams can:\n\n 1. Discover existing automation components\n 2. Understand exactly how to use them\n 3. Test them interactively\n 4. Integrate them into their own workflows\n\nJust as Storybook revolutionized UI component development by providing \"a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation,\" FlowBlocks provides a workshop for building, testing, and documenting automation components in isolation.\n\n\nThe Pain Points: Why Current Approaches Fall Short\n\nCurrent automation approaches face several critical limitations:\n\n\n1. Isolationist Development\n\nAutomations are created in isolated silos without visibility across teams. At Appolica, engineers found that while tools like GitHub Copilot and Codeium boosted individual productivity, there was no systematic way to share these automation wins across the organization.\n\n\n2. Redundant Efforts\n\nWithout a central registry, teams repeatedly build similar automation solutions independently. This redundancy wastes resources and creates inconsistent approaches to solving the same problems.\n\n\n3. Integration Headaches\n\nManual integration efforts cause slowdowns and increase dependencies. As Red Hat's research highlights, \"six of the 10 barriers cited in the survey were people-culture oriented barriers, not technical ones,\" with lack of training and fear of replacement being significant obstacles.\n\n\n4. Documentation Deficit\n\nPoor documentation makes reuse challenging, causing inefficiencies and frustration. Despite the availability of tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation, the integration between automation tools and documentation standards is not well established.\n\n\nThe FlowBlocks Solution\n\nFlowBlocks addresses these pain points through a structured framework built on four key principles:\n\n\n1. Grassroots Empowerment\n\nEmployees can easily create, identify, and document automation opportunities. This aligns with successful approaches seen at companies like Roo, where CTO John Stearns found that by \"leveraging AI tools effectively, they could double the number of product squads without significantly increasing engineering headcount.\"\n\n\n2. Systematic Integration with a Lego Block Philosophy\n\nAutomation components are designed as modular, reusable blocks that work together seamlessly—like Lego pieces. This modular approach ensures components are:\n\n * Discoverable: Easy to find in a central registry\n * Reusable: Designed with clear inputs and outputs\n * Testable: Can be validated independently before integration\n * Documented: Include comprehensive usage guides\n\n\n3. Component Registry: The Heart of the System\n\nThe component registry serves as the central nervous system of your automation strategy, providing:\n\n * Discovery: Makes components findable without reinventing the wheel\n * Documentation: Provides clear schemas for inputs and outputs\n * Governance: Manages versioning, ownership, and component lifecycle\n * Integration: Generates endpoints and connection points automatically\n * Access Control: Ensures proper security and permissions\n\nEach component in the registry is defined with:\n\n * Clear input/output schemas\n * Usage documentation and examples\n * Version history and compatibility notes\n * Owner and support contact information\n * Performance characteristics and limitations\n\n\n4. Interactive Testing and Cloud Exposure\n\nAutomation components are exposed through Swagger UI for immediate testing and ngrok for secure cloud access. This enables:\n\n * Real-time testing of components without complex setup\n * Secure exposure of local services for integration testing\n * Dynamic generation of public URLs for cloud service integration\n\n\nWhat FlowBlocks Helps Teams Do\n\nFlowBlocks transforms how teams work with automation:\n\n\nFor Employees\n\n * Simplify automation discovery: Find existing solutions instead of building from scratch\n * Accelerate implementation: Use pre-built components that work together\n * Reduce learning curve: Clear documentation makes adoption easier\n * Test with confidence: Interactive interfaces to validate behavior before integration\n\n\nFor Technical Teams\n\n * Standardize approaches: Establish consistent patterns for automation\n * Reduce duplication: Prevent multiple teams from solving the same problem\n * Improve quality: Tested, documented components reduce errors\n * Scale effectively: Components designed for reuse enable rapid expansion\n\n\nFor Executives\n\n * Strategic alignment: Connect automation to business objectives\n * Measurable impact: Clear metrics on component usage and value\n * Faster time-to-market: Modular approach accelerates implementation\n * Cost efficiency: Reusable components reduce redundant development\n\n\nTechnical Implementation\n\nFlowBlocks relies on several key technologies:\n\n * TypeScript/Zod: For schema definition and validation\n * Next.js/NestJS/Fastify: For endpoint generation and API hosting\n * Swagger/OpenAPI: For documentation and interactive API exploration\n * ngrok: For public endpoint tunneling and cloud access\n * n8n: For workflow creation and execution\n\nA typical workflow might look like:\n\n 1. Define a component with clear input/output schemas\n 2. The system automatically generates API endpoints and documentation\n 3. ngrok creates a secure tunnel for external testing\n 4. Swagger UI provides an interactive interface for testing\n 5. n8n integration templates are generated for easy workflow incorporation\n\n\nGlossary of Key Terms\n\n * Automation Component: A group of related code blocks with defined input schemas, outputs, documentation, and handlers.\n * Code Blocks: Individual, reusable snippets or logic modules used to build automation components.\n * Component Registry: Centralized repository listing automation components, their schemas, documentation, and integration endpoints.\n * n8n: An open-source, node-based automation tool that enables workflows through a visual interface, facilitating no-code integration.\n * Swagger/OpenAPI: Tools used for documenting APIs, providing interactive exploration, and real-time testing capabilities.\n * ngrok: Service for creating secure tunnels, exposing local server endpoints securely and publicly for testing and integration.\n\n\nMeasuring Success\n\nThe impact of FlowBlocks can be measured through:\n\n * Component reuse rate: How often components are shared across teams\n * Time savings: Workflows compressed from days to minutes\n * Adoption metrics: Number of users actively using the registry\n * Integration speed: Time required to incorporate components into workflows\n * Cross-functional usage: Components used across department boundaries\n\n\nBridging the Gap Between Strategy and Execution\n\nThe most powerful aspect of the FlowBlocks approach is how it bridges the gap between high-level strategy and ground-level execution—a key challenge identified in automation initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerspective\nTraditional Challenge\nFlowBlocks Solution\n\n\n\n\nExecutive (Macro)\nStrategic initiatives disconnected from implementation\nClear traceability from components to strategic objectives\n\n\nManagement (Meso)\nDifficulty standardizing approaches across teams\nCentralized governance and component registry\n\n\nEmployee (Micro)\nReinventing solutions that may exist elsewhere\nDiscoverable components with clear documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bridging function is what sets FlowBlocks apart from other approaches. It connects the dots between an executive's strategic vision and an employee's daily productivity needs.\n\n\nConclusion: A Call for Feedback\n\nAs I continue developing FlowBlocks, I'm actively seeking feedback from automation practitioners, team leads, and executives who face these challenges.\n\n * What aspects of FlowBlocks would bring the most value to your organization?\n * Are there specific features or integrations that would make it essential for your teams?\n * What challenges do you anticipate in implementing such a system?\n\nBy implementing a FlowBlocks approach, organizations can transform their automation efforts from isolated, redundant initiatives into a cohesive, scalable system that delivers measurable business impact.\n\nI believe the time to build your organization's automation component registry is now. The alternative? Watching your automation efforts remain fragmented, undocumented, and underutilized—a fate no forward-thinking organization can afford in today's competitive landscape.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on FlowBlocks! Reach out in the comments or directly to discuss how this concept could evolve to better serve your organization's needs.\n\nI'm excited to share FlowBlocks—a component registry for automation I've been working on—to get some early feedback from folks in the automation community. If you've ever felt the pain of reinventing automation wheels or hunting down undocumented workflows, I'd love to hear your thoughts!\n\nAfter spending years watching organizations struggle with disconnected automation tools and siloed workflows, I decided it was time to build something better. The problem was clear: we're all rushing to adopt automation and AI, but we're creating a mess of disconnected tools that nobody can find, use, or maintain. That's why I'm building FlowBlocks—a way to make automation components discoverable, reusable, and actually useful across your entire organization.\n\n\nThe Automation Mess We're All Living In\n\nLet's be honest—we're all drowning in automation tools. According to research, 77% of IT professionals consider automation essential to their operations. We've seen amazing success stories like US Acute Care Solutions automating 20 million medical records and saving 100,000 hours annually.\n\nBut here's the problem I keep seeing: all these automation efforts exist as islands. You build something awesome, and then what? It sits in your department, undocumented, while someone three desks away builds the exact same thing from scratch.\n\nLike you, I've watched platforms like Microsoft Power Automate and n8n gain traction, but they don't solve the fundamental problem—how do we create a shared library of automation components that everyone can use?\n\nI found myself asking: Why can't we have for automation what Storybook did for UI components? That's the spark that led to FlowBlocks.\n\n\nWhat's FlowBlocks? My Take on Fixing Automation Chaos\n\nFlowBlocks is my answer to this problem—a platform that makes automation components modular, discoverable, and testable. Think of it as your organization's automation library where anyone can:\n\n 1. Find automation components others have already built\n 2. See exactly how to use them (with actual documentation!)\n 3. Test them right there in the browser\n 4. Plug them into their own workflows\n\nI've been obsessed with how Storybook transformed UI development by letting us build and test components in isolation. FlowBlocks brings that same philosophy to automation workflows.\n\n\nThe Headaches We're All Experiencing\n\nIf you're like me, you've probably banged your head against these same walls:\n\n\nThe \"Who Built This?\" Problem\n\nHow many times have you discovered that three different teams built nearly identical automations because nobody knew what already existed? At a previous company, I watched engineering teams build GitHub Copilot and Codeium integrations over and over again, with no way to share what worked.\n\n\nThe Redundancy Nightmare\n\nYou finally nail that perfect integration between your CRM and billing system, only to learn that another team did the same thing last quarter—and theirs handles edge cases yours doesn't. Sound familiar?\n\n\nThe Integration Dance\n\nAs the Red Hat research pointed out, \"six of the 10 barriers to automation were people-culture oriented, not technical ones.\" I've lived this—spending weeks trying to integrate with someone else's automation because they've moved on and nobody documented how it works.\n\n\nThe Documentation Desert\n\nEven with great tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for APIs, I've rarely seen teams properly document their automation components. We're all guilty of the \"I'll document it later\" promise that never happens.\n\n\nHow FlowBlocks Fixes These Problems\n\nAfter experiencing these pain points firsthand, I've built FlowBlocks around four principles I believe can transform how we handle automation:\n\n\n1. Make Automation Accessible to Everyone\n\nI want everyone in your organization to easily create, find, and use automation components. I was inspired by what Roo's CTO John Stearns achieved, where \"leveraging AI tools effectively let them double the number of product squads without significantly increasing engineering headcount.\"\n\n\n2. Build Automation Like Lego Blocks\n\nRemember how satisfying it is to snap Lego pieces together? That's how automation should work. Each component in FlowBlocks is designed as a modular, reusable block with:\n\n * A find-me-easily design so anyone can discover it\n * Clear inputs and outputs so you know exactly what it needs and gives\n * Built-in testing so you can validate it works before integrating\n * Actual documentation (I know, revolutionary concept!)\n\n\n3. Create a Central Library Everyone Uses\n\nThe heart of FlowBlocks is the component registry, which serves as your organization's single source of truth for automation. It handles:\n\n * Finding stuff: No more \"I think Sarah built something like this once...\"\n * Understanding stuff: Clear documentation of what each component expects and returns\n * Managing stuff: Version control, ownership, and lifecycle management\n * Connecting stuff: Automatically generated endpoints and connection points\n * Securing stuff: Proper access controls so the right people can use the right components\n\n\n4. Make Testing and Integration Painless\n\nI've integrated Swagger UI for instant testing and ngrok for secure cloud access because, let's face it, testing automation components shouldn't require an engineering degree.\n\n\nWhat FlowBlocks Will Do For Your Team\n\nI'm building FlowBlocks to transform how your teams work with automation:\n\n\nFor You and Your Colleagues\n\n * Find stuff fast: Discover existing solutions instead of building from scratch\n * Build stuff faster: Use pre-built components that work together\n * Learn stuff easier: Clear documentation makes adoption painless\n * Trust stuff more: Test components before you integrate them\n\n\nFor Your Technical Teams\n\n * One way to solve problems: Establish consistent patterns for automation\n * Stop rebuilding the wheel: Prevent multiple teams solving the same problem\n * Fewer bugs: Tested, documented components mean fewer errors\n * Scale without pain: Components designed for reuse enable rapid expansion\n\n\nFor Your Leadership\n\n * Connect to strategy: Link automation directly to business objectives\n * See actual impact: Clear metrics on component usage and value\n * Move faster: Modular approach accelerates implementation\n * Save money: Reusable components reduce redundant development\n\n\nHow I'm Building It\n\nI'm building FlowBlocks using technologies I believe strike the right balance between power and accessibility:\n\n * TypeScript/Zod: For rock-solid schema definition\n * Next.js/NestJS/Fastify: For fast, reliable endpoints and APIs\n * Swagger/OpenAPI: For documentation you'll actually use\n * ngrok: For secure tunneling without the network pain\n * n8n: For creating workflows people actually understand\n\nHere's how I envision you using FlowBlocks:\n\n 1. Define a component with clear schemas (don't worry, the interface makes this easy)\n 2. The system automatically creates API endpoints and documentation\n 3. Ngrok sets up a secure tunnel for testing from anywhere\n 4. Swagger UI gives you a playground to test your component\n 5. N8n templates are generated so anyone can use your component\n\n\nQuick Glossary Because Jargon Is Annoying\n\n * Automation Component: A reusable piece of automation logic with defined inputs and outputs\n * Code Blocks: The individual building blocks that make up a component\n * Component Registry: Your central library of available automation components\n * n8n: An open-source automation tool with a visual interface\n * Swagger/OpenAPI: Tools for documenting and testing APIs\n * ngrok: A service that creates secure tunnels to your local environment\n\n\nHow You'll Know It's Working\n\nWhen FlowBlocks is successfully implemented in your organization, you'll see:\n\n * People reusing components instead of building new ones\n * Workflows that used to take days completed in minutes\n * More people across different teams using automation\n * Faster integration of components into new workflows\n * Components being shared across departments that never collaborated before\n\n\nConnecting Strategy to Execution\n\nWhat I'm most excited about is how FlowBlocks bridges the gap between high-level strategy and the day-to-day work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nCurrent Frustration\nHow FlowBlocks Helps\n\n\n\n\nExecutive\n\"Why aren't our strategic initiatives being implemented?\"\nComponents directly trace back to strategic objectives\n\n\nManagement\n\"Why is every team doing things differently?\"\nCentralized governance creates consistency\n\n\nIndividual\n\"I know someone built this already, but I can't find it!\"\nDiscoverable components with clear documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what makes FlowBlocks different—it connects what your executives want with what your employees need to do their jobs.\n\n\nI Want Your Feedback!\n\nI'm building FlowBlocks because I've lived with these automation headaches, and I bet you have too. Now I need your help to make it better:\n\n * Which of these problems resonates most with your experience?\n * What features would make FlowBlocks a must-have for your organization?\n * What challenges do you see in getting people to adopt something like this?\n\nI truly believe that by taking a more structured approach to automation components, we can transform isolated, redundant initiatives into a cohesive system that actually delivers results.\n\nThe alternative? More of the same chaos we've all been living with—fragmented automation efforts that nobody can find, use, or maintain. And I don't know about you, but I've had enough of that.\n\nReach out: doug@withseismic.com / linkedin.com/in/dougsilkstone\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on FlowBlocks!

Capitalize on any unfair advantages you have, and use them as superpowers.</li><li><strong>Dopeness as a Superweapon:</strong> The world is filled with mediocrity. We don’t just create things; we forge impossibly dope products, experiences, and services. It’s our nuke in the arms race of life.</li><li><strong>Speed Over Perfection:</strong> Some people wait for perfect, but perfect waits for no one. Deliver now, and optimize later. Fast execution beats flawless planning.</li><li><strong>Maximal Results, Minimal Effort:</strong> We don’t just cut corners; we redesign the shape. We eliminate the unnecessary so the necessary may speak.</li><li><strong>Hack the System:</strong> Conventional wisdom is just that — conventional.

Every resource saved is a bullet in our arsenal.</li><li><strong>People as Multipliers:</strong> Building a team? Find other Corner Cutters. Synergy isn’t just 1+1=3; it’s exponential growth fueled by collective cunning. Humans and robots, together in dopeness.</li><li><strong>Win-Win or No Deal:</strong> Manipulation is short-lived. We aim for win-win outcomes that build trust, rapport, and long-lasting relationships.</li><li><strong>Data is the Oracle:</strong> Gut instinct has its place, but data guides us towards objective truths. We A/B test life until it yields the result we want.</li><li><strong>Iterate, Iterate, Iterate:</strong> Today’s innovation is tomorrow’s antique. We’re always in Beta, forever on the edge of the next big pivot.</li><li><strong>Monetization is Not a Dirty Word:</strong> Money isn’t the end goal; it's the means to create more dopeness. As long as the world runs on currency, we will, too.</li><li><strong>Authenticity Above All:</strong> Authenticity is magnetic. The world sees through facades; true influence comes from being genuine.</li></ol><hr><p>We are the Corner Cutters. We don't just break molds; we never used one to begin with. We create shortcuts not to cheat life but to live more of it.</p><p>Join us if you dare, but prepare yourself for a life less ordinary, a journey of unexpected twists, and a perpetual quest to make the universe as dope as humanly — and technologically — possible.</p><p>Let this manifesto be your guide and your contract with reality. Go forth and be dope.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-our-tribe\">Who is Our Tribe?</h2><p>Our tribe is a motley crew of rebels and dreamers, of rational anarchists and calculated risk-takers. We're the hackers in the garage, the artists with a spreadsheet, the corporate renegades, and the startup savages. We're diverse in skills but unified in mindset — we exist to defy the status quo and to redefine what’s possible.</p><h3 id=\"what-do-we-strive-for\">What Do We Strive For?</h3><p>We strive for maximum impact with minimal drag. We aim to live our lives as a series of optimized algorithms, each one designed to elevate our game. Our goal isn't just success; it's groundbreaking innovation, it's to shake the pillars of any industry we touch and leave a legacy of dopeness in our wake.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-we-win\">How Do We Win?</h3><ol><li><strong>Strategic Leverage:</strong> We identify the most potent points of intervention and apply force there.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Arbitrage:</strong> We continuously learn, diversify our skills, and cross-pollinate ideas from different domains.</li><li><strong>Collaborative Overdrive:</strong> Networking isn’t just a career booster; it's a life multiplier. We surround ourselves with other Corner Cutters to amplify our collective efficiency.</li><li><strong>Agile Execution:</strong> We operate in sprints, adapt to feedback, and iterate rapidly. We get things done, and we get them done fast.</li></ol><h3 id=\"why-do-we-do-it\">Why Do We Do It?</h3><ol><li><strong>The Thrill of the Game:</strong> Life is a grand sandbox of possibilities, and we want to explore every corner, climb every mountain, and dive into every ocean.</li><li><strong>Creative Satisfaction:</strong> We get an immense sense of joy and fulfillment from building something dope, something that turns heads, drops jaws, and makes hearts beat faster.</li><li><strong>Financial Freedom:</strong> Money is a tool, and like any tool, it can be wielded for great good or great ill. We choose to master it so that we can fund ever grander schemes of dopeness.</li><li><strong>Legacy:</strong> To live is good, but to live on in the hearts and minds of those we’ve impacted — that is greatness. We aim to leave the world better, cooler, and significantly more dope than we found it.</li></ol><p>So we don’t just cut corners for the sake of expediency; we do it to redefine what's achievable. We're not here to play the game. We're here to change it. Because, in the grand scheme of things, what's more dope than that?</p><p>Corner Cutters, now is the time. Unite, transform, ignite — and let's build a world as extraordinary as we are.</p><hr><h2 id=\"elaboration-on-core-tenets-of-the-corner-cutters-manifesto\">Elaboration on Core Tenets of The Corner Cutters Manifesto</h2><h3 id=\"unfair-advantages-are-opportunities\">Unfair Advantages are Opportunities</h3><p>An unfair advantage isn't just a lucky break; it's a treasure map waiting to be deciphered. Whether it's specialized knowledge, social connections, or a unique skill, we leverage these resources to their full potential. We don't believe in \"playing fair\" when we could be playing smart. For us, every disadvantage is a challenge, and every advantage is an opportunity to set new norms.</p><h3 id=\"dopeness-as-a-superweapon\">Dopeness as a Superweapon</h3><p>In a world rife with mediocrity, the extraordinary stands out like a supernova in the night sky. Our drive to create things that are not just good, but extraordinarily dope, is a testament to our will. This isn't just about aesthetics; it's about functionality, impact, and emotional resonance. When something is genuinely dope, it attracts attention, builds loyalty, and turns the tables in our favor.</p><h3 id=\"speed-over-perfection\">Speed Over Perfection</h3><p>In the time it takes for most to perfect a plan, we've already executed, learned, and optimized. Our mantra is simple: done is better than perfect. While others aim for unattainable perfection, we shoot for fast execution and continuous improvement. We don't let the fear of failure slow us down because we know that speed is a competitive edge that can be more potent than perfection.</p><h3 id=\"maximal-results-minimal-effort\">Maximal Results, Minimal Effort</h3><p>For us, efficiency is an art form. We scrutinize every process, dissect every system, and cut away every inefficiency. The goal? To accomplish more with less. This isn't about laziness; it's about maximizing returns. Every ounce of effort saved is reinvested into making things even more dope than they already are.</p><h3 id=\"hack-the-system\">Hack the System</h3><p>To us, rules are more like guidelines. While we respect the laws and social contracts that keep society functioning, we see many \"best practices\" for what they are: limited perspectives. So we challenge the norms. We test the boundaries. And if it benefits us and our tribe, we don't hesitate to rewrite the rulebook.</p><h3 id=\"frugality-as-a-virtue\">Frugality as a Virtue</h3><p>We see every resource—whether it's time, money, or energy—as a finite commodity to be spent wisely. This isn't about penny-pinching but about understanding the value of what we have and using it to its fullest potential. Frugality equips us to do more with less, transforming limitations into opportunities for innovation.</p><h3 id=\"people-as-multipliers\">People as Multipliers</h3><p>Our tribe is our greatest asset. Each member amplifies our capabilities, contributes unique skills, and offers fresh perspectives. Synergy isn't just about addition; it's about exponential growth. When we unite as Corner Cutters, we don't just achieve our goals; we redefine what's possible.</p><h3 id=\"win-win-or-no-deal\">Win-Win or No Deal</h3><p>Short-term gains from manipulation or deceit are just that—short-lived. Our aim is to create scenarios where everyone walks away better off. By focusing on win-win outcomes, we build a network of trust and collaboration that can fuel long-term success for everyone involved.</p><h3 id=\"data-is-the-oracle\">Data is the Oracle</h3><p>In a world full of opinions, data is our North Star. We live in an era where almost everything can be quantified, analyzed, and optimized. We believe in the power of data to reveal truths, expose gaps, and guide our decision-making. Gut instinct is the starting line; data-driven decisions are how we win the race.</p><h3 id=\"iterate-iterate-iterate\">Iterate, Iterate, Iterate</h3><p>We never rest on our laurels. The moment we achieve something, we're already focused on making it better. We are in a perpetual state of beta, always iterating, always evolving. What was revolutionary today will be outdated tomorrow, and we're here to stay ahead of the curve.</p><h3 id=\"monetization-is-not-a-dirty-word\">Monetization is Not a Dirty Word</h3><p>Money is a tool, and we're craftsmen. We use it to leverage opportunities, to scale what’s working, and most importantly, to fund our next venture into dopeness. Monetization is merely a mechanism for creating value and rewarding it. The goal isn't just wealth; it's the capability to make things as dope</p><p>as possible.</p><h3 id=\"authenticity-above-all\">Authenticity Above All</h3><p>In an age of filters and facades, being genuine is revolutionary. Our realness is our badge of honor. It allows us to connect, to influence, and to lead. Authenticity isn't a strategy; it's a core value. People don't just want to follow someone who appears great; they want to follow someone who is genuinely dope.</p><p>Through these tenets, we navigate the complexities of life, always with an eye for the shortcut that maximizes dopeness. These aren't just guidelines; they're the codes we live by. They're what makes us Corner Cutters, and they're what will make us legends in the annals of dopeness.</p><h3 id=\"the-art-of-borrowing-reimagining-not-rehashing\">The Art of Borrowing: Reimagining, Not Rehashing</h3><p>In a world that rewards originality, borrowing is often seen as a lesser form of creativity. But let's get one thing straight: we're not talking about plagiarism or theft. We're talking about the ability to see the genius in something that already exists and to adapt it into something uniquely dope. Borrowing is about standing on the shoulders of giants to reach new heights.</p><p>The landscape of art, science, and innovation is littered with ideas that have been remixed, reimagined, and repurposed. From sampling in music to open-source software in technology, borrowing is a cornerstone of modern creativity. Why start from scratch when someone else has already laid down a foundation?</p><p>The key here is to borrow in a way that adds value, not just replicates it. If you're going to borrow an idea or a concept, put your unique spin on it. Make it more efficient, give it a fresh design, or apply it in a completely new context. The goal is to make it so dope that people forget it was ever borrowed in the first place.</p><p>When you borrow, give credit where credit is due, but don't let the origins hold you back from making something extraordinary. After all, imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but transformation is the sincerest form of respect.</p><p>So go ahead, borrow, but make it dope. Because in the end, what makes an idea truly great isn't where it comes from, but where we take it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"quotes\">Quotes</h2><ul><li><strong>Hack the System:</strong> \"Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine.\"</li><li><strong>Frugality as a Virtue:</strong> \"Waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both.\"</li><li><strong>People as Multipliers:</strong> \"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\"</li><li><strong>Win-Win or No Deal:</strong> \"Success in business requires training and discipline and hard work.

Win-Win or No Deal: Manipulation is short-lived. We aim for win-win outcomes that build trust, rapport, and long-lasting relationships.\n 9.  Data is the Oracle: Gut instinct has its place, but data guides us towards objective truths. We A/B test life until it yields the result we want.\n 10. Iterate, Iterate, Iterate: Today’s innovation is tomorrow’s antique. We’re always in Beta, forever on the edge of the next big pivot.\n 11. Monetization is Not a Dirty Word: Money isn’t the end goal; it's the means to create more dopeness. As long as the world runs on currency, we will, too.\n 12. Authenticity Above All: Authenticity is magnetic. The world sees through facades; true influence comes from being genuine.\n\nWe are the Corner Cutters. We don't just break molds; we never used one to begin with. We create shortcuts not to cheat life but to live more of it.\n\nJoin us if you dare, but prepare yourself for a life less ordinary, a journey of unexpected twists, and a perpetual quest to make the universe as dope as humanly — and technologically — possible.\n\nLet this manifesto be your guide and your contract with reality. Go forth and be dope.\n\n\nWho is Our Tribe?\n\nOur tribe is a motley crew of rebels and dreamers, of rational anarchists and calculated risk-takers. We're the hackers in the garage, the artists with a spreadsheet, the corporate renegades, and the startup savages. We're diverse in skills but unified in mindset — we exist to defy the status quo and to redefine what’s possible.\n\n\nWhat Do We Strive For?\n\nWe strive for maximum impact with minimal drag. We aim to live our lives as a series of optimized algorithms, each one designed to elevate our game. Our goal isn't just success; it's groundbreaking innovation, it's to shake the pillars of any industry we touch and leave a legacy of dopeness in our wake.\n\n\nHow Do We Win?\n\n 1. Strategic Leverage: We identify the most potent points of intervention and apply force there.\n 2. Knowledge Arbitrage: We continuously learn, diversify our skills, and cross-pollinate ideas from different domains.\n 3. Collaborative Overdrive: Networking isn’t just a career booster; it's a life multiplier. We surround ourselves with other Corner Cutters to amplify our collective efficiency.\n 4. Agile Execution: We operate in sprints, adapt to feedback, and iterate rapidly. We get things done, and we get them done fast.\n\n\nWhy Do We Do It?\n\n 1. The Thrill of the Game: Life is a grand sandbox of possibilities, and we want to explore every corner, climb every mountain, and dive into every ocean.\n 2. Creative Satisfaction: We get an immense sense of joy and fulfillment from building something dope, something that turns heads, drops jaws, and makes hearts beat faster.\n 3. Financial Freedom: Money is a tool, and like any tool, it can be wielded for great good or great ill. We choose to master it so that we can fund ever grander schemes of dopeness.\n 4. Legacy: To live is good, but to live on in the hearts and minds of those we’ve impacted — that is greatness. We aim to leave the world better, cooler, and significantly more dope than we found it.\n\nSo we don’t just cut corners for the sake of expediency; we do it to redefine what's achievable. We're not here to play the game. We're here to change it. Because, in the grand scheme of things, what's more dope than that?\n\nCorner Cutters, now is the time. Unite, transform, ignite — and let's build a world as extraordinary as we are.\n\n\nElaboration on Core Tenets of The Corner Cutters Manifesto\n\n\nUnfair Advantages are Opportunities\n\nAn unfair advantage isn't just a lucky break; it's a treasure map waiting to be deciphered. Whether it's specialized knowledge, social connections, or a unique skill, we leverage these resources to their full potential. We don't believe in \"playing fair\" when we could be playing smart. For us, every disadvantage is a challenge, and every advantage is an opportunity to set new norms.\n\n\nDopeness as a Superweapon\n\nIn a world rife with mediocrity, the extraordinary stands out like a supernova in the night sky. Our drive to create things that are not just good, but extraordinarily dope, is a testament to our will. This isn't just about aesthetics; it's about functionality, impact, and emotional resonance. When something is genuinely dope, it attracts attention, builds loyalty, and turns the tables in our favor.\n\n\nSpeed Over Perfection\n\nIn the time it takes for most to perfect a plan, we've already executed, learned, and optimized. Our mantra is simple: done is better than perfect. While others aim for unattainable perfection, we shoot for fast execution and continuous improvement. We don't let the fear of failure slow us down because we know that speed is a competitive edge that can be more potent than perfection.\n\n\nMaximal Results, Minimal Effort\n\nFor us, efficiency is an art form. We scrutinize every process, dissect every system, and cut away every inefficiency. The goal? To accomplish more with less. This isn't about laziness; it's about maximizing returns. Every ounce of effort saved is reinvested into making things even more dope than they already are.\n\n\nHack the System\n\nTo us, rules are more like guidelines. While we respect the laws and social contracts that keep society functioning, we see many \"best practices\" for what they are: limited perspectives. So we challenge the norms. We test the boundaries. And if it benefits us and our tribe, we don't hesitate to rewrite the rulebook.\n\n\nFrugality as a Virtue\n\nWe see every resource—whether it's time, money, or energy—as a finite commodity to be spent wisely. This isn't about penny-pinching but about understanding the value of what we have and using it to its fullest potential. Frugality equips us to do more with less, transforming limitations into opportunities for innovation.\n\n\nPeople as Multipliers\n\nOur tribe is our greatest asset. Each member amplifies our capabilities, contributes unique skills, and offers fresh perspectives. Synergy isn't just about addition; it's about exponential growth. When we unite as Corner Cutters, we don't just achieve our goals; we redefine what's possible.\n\n\nWin-Win or No Deal\n\nShort-term gains from manipulation or deceit are just that—short-lived. Our aim is to create scenarios where everyone walks away better off. By focusing on win-win outcomes, we build a network of trust and collaboration that can fuel long-term success for everyone involved.\n\n\nData is the Oracle\n\nIn a world full of opinions, data is our North Star. We live in an era where almost everything can be quantified, analyzed, and optimized. We believe in the power of data to reveal truths, expose gaps, and guide our decision-making. Gut instinct is the starting line; data-driven decisions are how we win the race.\n\n\nIterate, Iterate, Iterate\n\nWe never rest on our laurels. The moment we achieve something, we're already focused on making it better. We are in a perpetual state of beta, always iterating, always evolving. What was revolutionary today will be outdated tomorrow, and we're here to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n\nMonetization is Not a Dirty Word\n\nMoney is a tool, and we're craftsmen. We use it to leverage opportunities, to scale what’s working, and most importantly, to fund our next venture into dopeness. Monetization is merely a mechanism for creating value and rewarding it. The goal isn't just wealth; it's the capability to make things as dope\n\nas possible.\n\n\nAuthenticity Above All\n\nIn an age of filters and facades, being genuine is revolutionary. Our realness is our badge of honor. It allows us to connect, to influence, and to lead. Authenticity isn't a strategy; it's a core value. People don't just want to follow someone who appears great; they want to follow someone who is genuinely dope.\n\nThrough these tenets, we navigate the complexities of life, always with an eye for the shortcut that maximizes dopeness. These aren't just guidelines; they're the codes we live by. They're what makes us Corner Cutters, and they're what will make us legends in the annals of dopeness.\n\n\nThe Art of Borrowing: Reimagining, Not Rehashing\n\nIn a world that rewards originality, borrowing is often seen as a lesser form of creativity. But let's get one thing straight: we're not talking about plagiarism or theft. We're talking about the ability to see the genius in something that already exists and to adapt it into something uniquely dope. Borrowing is about standing on the shoulders of giants to reach new heights.\n\nThe landscape of art, science, and innovation is littered with ideas that have been remixed, reimagined, and repurposed. From sampling in music to open-source software in technology, borrowing is a cornerstone of modern creativity. Why start from scratch when someone else has already laid down a foundation?\n\nThe key here is to borrow in a way that adds value, not just replicates it. If you're going to borrow an idea or a concept, put your unique spin on it. Make it more efficient, give it a fresh design, or apply it in a completely new context. The goal is to make it so dope that people forget it was ever borrowed in the first place.\n\nWhen you borrow, give credit where credit is due, but don't let the origins hold you back from making something extraordinary. After all, imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but transformation is the sincerest form of respect.\n\nSo go ahead, borrow, but make it dope. Because in the end, what makes an idea truly great isn't where it comes from, but where we take it.\n\n\nQuotes\n\n * Hack the System: \"Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine.\"\n * Frugality as a Virtue: \"Waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both.\"\n * People as Multipliers: \"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\"\n * Win-Win or No Deal: \"Success in business requires training and discipline and hard work.

We don't just break molds; we never used one to begin with. We create shortcuts not to cheat life but to live more of it.\n\nJoin us if you dare, but prepare yourself for a life less ordinary, a journey of unexpected twists, and a perpetual quest to make the universe as dope as humanly — and technologically — possible.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf this manifesto resonates with you, chances are you've been harboring feelings that linger just beneath the surface—a dull, ceaseless itch. It’s the unsettling notion that there’s more to your existence than what has been scripted for you by the unseen mechanisms of society.

The solutions we build will be things we use ourselves every day because they genuinely add value, and that's what I'm looking for.\n\n\nStanding Out in a Noisy Space\n\nWe've seen waves of digital specialties come and go—old school affiliate marketers turned to PPC, which evolved into digital marketing, then growth hackers, growth engineers, and now GTM (Go-To-Market) engineering is a thing for better or worse. Now many are pivoting to sell courses or promote the next shiny object, whether it was Web3 or now AI and automation.\n\nI'm aiming for longevity with my approach because I know something fresh will inevitably come along, and everyone else will move on to that. I've had to come to terms with the fact that I need to compete in this space, but I've also realized that my technical acumen, wisdom, and knowledge shouldn't be boiled down to a $20 subscription. We all need to remember that as experts—our value extends far beyond templated solutions.\n\nAs my manifesto states: \"Data is the Oracle. In a world full of opinions, data is our North Star.\" While LLMs represent something truly disruptive with tangible value, they're just one tool in my arsenal guided by data-driven decisions. I'm already thinking about what comes next, because LLMs alone don't generate income and GDP—humans do.\n\n\nAddressing the \"But What About Social Proof?\" Question\n\nLet me be clear—I'm not advocating that my clients should remove social proof from their websites. Case studies, testimonials, and logos are proven conversion elements that I'll continue to recommend in most business contexts. Social proof wins. Case studies win.\n\nBut my personal website is playing in a different space.\n\nThis is me doing work that I can genuinely get behind. Yes, I need a pipeline, and yes, at some point you have to act like a business—but I'm not driving cold traffic to my site and trying to convince strangers to work with me. That's what my content across other platforms accomplishes.\n\nI don't need flashy elements anymore. I'm not trying to impress anyone. The people who matter to me already see the value in what I do, and they're the ones I want to work with. My personal website is for those who already know me through my content elsewhere—it's a destination, not a discovery platform. And it's definitely not going to be like the others.\n\n\nPersonal Values & The Corner Cutters Manifesto\n\nEverything I do professionally is guided by \"The Corner Cutters Manifesto,\" a philosophy I've developed over years of working things out. Far from encouraging cutting corners in terms of quality, it's about finding ingenious ways to maximize impact while eliminating unnecessary effort—\"to accomplish more with less.\"\n\nSome of the core tenets that guide my work include:\n\n * Dopeness as a Superweapon: \"The world is filled with mediocrity. We don't just create things; we forge impossibly dope products, experiences, and services.\" I believe in creating work so exceptional it serves as a competitive advantage.\n * Hack the System: \"Conventional wisdom is just that—conventional. We challenge norms, we question rules, and when it serves us, we rewrite them.\" This explains why I've rejected the standard agency website template.\n * Authenticity Above All: \"In an age of filters and facades, being genuine is revolutionary. Our realness is our badge of honor.\" My new website is the embodiment of this principle.\n * Maximal Results, Minimal Effort: \"We don't just cut corners; we redesign the shape. We eliminate the unnecessary so the necessary may speak.\" This drives my approach to automation and technology.\n * Iterate, Iterate, Iterate: \"Today's innovation is tomorrow's antique. We're always in Beta, forever on the edge of the next big pivot.\" I'm constantly evolving my approaches rather than settling.\n\nThis manifesto isn't just words on a page—it's the operational code that drives every business decision I make. Stripping my website of conventional elements was simply aligning my online presence with these deeply held values.\n\n\nEmbracing the Next Chapter\n\nI'm turning 37 in a week, and I'm ready for this next chapter. People who come to my website aren't being sold on my past—they know me from my content on LinkedIn or YouTube. I don't feel the need to impress anyone with logos, awards, or credentials. I'm just here doing what I'm doing now, letting the work speak for itself.\n\nIn a world where everyone follows the same patterns, I'm comfortable being different. I feel like an early adopter ahead of the curve, and it's time to capitalize on that position.\n\nAs my manifesto declares: \"We are the Corner Cutters. We don't just break molds; we never used one to begin with. We create shortcuts not to cheat life but to live more of it.\"\n\nThat's why I've stripped everything back on my new website. There isn't much there yet, but I'll be adding articles, features, and YouTube videos. I recently hit 2,000 subscribers and plan to invest more in that platform.\n\nI feel good about where I am professionally and focused on doing my life's best work.\n\nI want to partner with people who champion the same concerns because there's wealth to be created and wins to be had—and I want to be there for them.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568733873715-f9d497a47ea0?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fGFic3RyYWN0JTIwdGV4dHVyZSUyMGJsYWNrfGVufDB8fHx8MTc0MjQ3NTMxOXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-13T08:15:11.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-20T12:55:51.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-13T08:17:11.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"67bc1b729a94ae0008edbfad","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67d2a88606b2ad0001fc30d1","uuid":"fa32ed16-cdae-41f3-8f2f-ebb9b5489b1b","title":"The Corner Cutters' Guide to Building the Future","slug":"the-corner-cutters-guide-to-building-the-future","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Real Digital Excellence Without the Industry Bullshit\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Real lessons from 15+ years in digital.

Create Dopeness, Skip Mediocrity</h3><p>Exceptional quality trumps marketing every time. Skip the fancy pitch deck and create something genuinely impressive. When your work stands out, it speaks for itself.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Put your energy into making your product, service, or content remarkable rather than just convincing people it is. The best marketing is work so good it demands attention. Let others spend their budgets on ads while you invest in creating something worth talking about.</p><p><strong>Action steps:</strong></p><ul><li>Would I genuinely be excited to use this myself?</li><li>Does this solve a real problem in a meaningfully better way?</li><li>If my brand name were removed, would this still stand out?</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-weaponize-all-advantages\">2. Weaponize All Advantages</h3><p>Life is too short to wait for perfect conditions. Use your unique skills, perspectives, and resources today. Don't wait for permission or perfect circumstances. Don't apologize, and don't try to explain. Most don't move at your speed.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Leverage every asset at your disposal—whether it's technical expertise, industry connections, or unique perspective. Your competitive edge comes from exploiting the specific advantages only you possess. If you write code, build your own tools. If you have a network, activate it with purpose. If you understand a market niche deeply, double down on that understanding.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>What unique combination of skills/experiences do I have that others don't?</li><li>Which of my resources are currently underutilized?</li><li>What can I execute on immediately without additional approvals or resources?</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-ship-now-perfect-later\">3. Ship Now, Perfect Later</h3><p>Launch your MVP while others are still planning. Learn from real usage, and improve based on data. The perfect version 3.0 is worthless if version 1.0 never ships.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Release early and often. Define your minimum viable product by what solves the core problem, not what satisfies your perfectionism. Gather feedback from real users rather than speculation. Iterate rapidly based on real-world data, not conference room hypotheticals.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>What's the smallest version of this that delivers real value?</li><li>Which features can be added later without compromising the core function?</li><li>How quickly can we get this in front of actual users?</li></ul><h3 id=\"4-eliminate-unnecessary-steps\">4. Eliminate Unnecessary Steps</h3><p>Build workflows around one question: \"What's the minimum viable process for exceptional results?\" Cut the fluff that prevents quality, keep the essentials that ensure it.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Audit your workflows regularly. Challenge every meeting, document, and approval step. Ask whether each element directly contributes to quality outcomes or just creates the appearance of diligence. Reconstruct processes from first principles rather than layering new steps onto outdated frameworks.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>Does this step directly improve the final output?</li><li>Is this meeting necessary, or could it be an async communication?</li><li>If we started from scratch, would we include this step?</li></ul><h3 id=\"5-question-every-best-practice\">5. Question Every \"Best Practice\"</h3><p>Industry standards often exist simply because \"that's how it's always been done.\" The best approaches rarely come from industry consensus. Challenge everything, especially what \"everyone knows.\" The internet is written for likes.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> When someone cites a best practice, ask for evidence, not just assertions. Test conventional wisdom against your specific context. Look for the competitive advantage in zigging while others zag. Consider that many industry standards evolved to serve agencies and vendors, not clients or users.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>Who benefits most from this \"best practice\"?</li><li>What evidence supports this approach beyond anecdotes?</li><li>What would happen if we did the opposite?</li></ul><h3 id=\"6-build-for-humans-automate-the-rest\">6. Build for Humans, Automate the Rest</h3><p>Let humans focus on what they do best: creativity, critical thinking, and connection. Automate everything else. Keep humans \"in the loop\" for critical decisions while eliminating tedious tasks.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Map your workflows and identify every routine, predictable task. Build systems to handle these automatically, leaving your team free to focus on high-judgment work. Use technology to enhance human capabilities rather than replacing them. Create smart defaults that handle common scenarios while allowing human override for exceptions.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>Which tasks require uniquely human judgment?</li><li>What routine work is currently consuming creative energy?</li><li>How can we create systems that handle the predictable cases automatically?</li></ul><h3 id=\"7-make-efficiency-your-advantage\">7. Make Efficiency Your Advantage</h3><p>Well-funded operations often achieve less than bootstrapped ones. Efficiency with resources—time, money, attention—creates sustainability and freedom. Every dollar saved becomes a dollar you can invest where it matters.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Optimize for maximum impact per unit of resource. Treat funding as a tool, not a goal. Create nimble operations that can pivot quickly and survive market fluctuations. Focus on sustainable growth over vanity metrics. Keep overhead low and capabilities high.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>What's our ratio of output to input compared to industry averages?</li><li>Where are we spending that doesn't directly create value?</li><li>How can we accomplish more with our existing resources?</li></ul><h3 id=\"8-build-networks-of-doers-not-talkers\">8. Build Networks of Doers, Not Talkers</h3><p>Seek collaborators who complement your skills and share a bias toward action. One person who consistently delivers is worth ten who just strategize. Build connections with those who ship.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Evaluate potential partners based on their track record of execution, not just their ideas or credentials. Create alliances with those who have complementary capabilities but similar values. Share opportunities with those who have proven they can deliver. Minimize time spent with those who theorize but never implement.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>Does this person have a portfolio of completed work?</li><li>Do they talk more about what they will do or what they have done?</li><li>When faced with obstacles, do they find solutions or find excuses?</li></ul><h3 id=\"9-use-data-to-decide-instinct-to-execute\">9. Use Data to Decide, Instinct to Execute</h3><p>Balance data-driven decision making with practical judgment. Collect meaningful metrics on everything you build, but don't let analysis paralysis prevent decisive action. Let data inform strategy while experience guides execution.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Establish clear metrics for success before launching initiatives. Build measurement into everything from the start. Use quantitative data to identify opportunities and problems, but apply qualitative judgment to determine solutions. Recognize when you have sufficient information to act versus when you need more data.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>What specific metrics will tell us if this is working?</li><li>At what point will we have enough data to make a decision?</li><li>Which aspects of this decision can be quantified, and which require judgment?</li></ul><h3 id=\"10-dogfood-your-solutions\">10. Dogfood Your Solutions</h3><p>Never sell what you wouldn't use yourself. Implement in your own workflow first. This \"dogfooding\" approach ensures that solutions solve real problems, not theoretical ones. Ground your work in reality, not slide decks.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Be your own first and most demanding customer. Experience the pain points firsthand before proposing solutions. Test your approaches in your own business before recommending them to clients. Let your internal needs drive innovation that can then be externalized.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>Would I actually use this myself, regularly?</li><li>What irritates me about this solution when I use it?</li><li>Have I solved a problem I personally experience, or one I merely observed?</li></ul><h3 id=\"11-evolve-constantly-dont-chase-trends\">11. Evolve Constantly, Don't Chase Trends</h3><p>The industry cycles through specialists, experts, hackers, and now AI evangelists. Focus on fundamental value creation while integrating new tools appropriately. View technologies as tools in your arsenal, not your entire strategy.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Distinguish between fundamental shifts and passing fads.

Choose Authenticity Over Polish</h3><p>Authentic connection beats polished marketing. Show who you really are—it attracts the right people and repels the wrong ones. True influence comes from being genuine, not from performing professionalism.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Communicate directly and honestly, even when it's uncomfortable. Share your actual work process, including the challenges. Let your personality and values show in your communications.

Create Mutual Value or Walk Away</h3><p>Prioritize outcomes over billings. Every project must create genuine value for all involved. Apply expertise where it makes a meaningful difference. When there's no path to mutual benefit, walk away.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Evaluate potential projects based on value creation, not just revenue.

Think of it as giving AI the ability to reach beyond its text box and actually do things in the real world.</p><p>Here's why that matters: AI models are great at understanding language and generating content, but they're isolated from your actual work environment. They can't natively access your databases, call your APIs, or interact with your team's tools.</p><p>MCP solves this problem by creating a connection layer. When your AI needs to check JIRA tickets, send a Slack message, or query your product database, it can do that through MCP.</p><p>The excitement around MCP comes from its practical applications:</p><ul><li>Engineers can build tools that AI can call directly</li><li>Teams can connect their existing systems to AI workflows</li><li>The same tools work across different AI interfaces (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor)</li><li>Custom workflows become possible without rebuilding everything</li></ul><p>In practice, an MCP is a server that knows about your tools and makes them available to AI.

That's where WithSeismic MCP Boilerplate comes in – it's like Next.js for MCP, abstracting away the complexity so you can focus on building tools, not infrastructure.\n\nHere's how simple it is to create a tool with WithSeismic MCP:\n\nexport const myTool = new Tool({\n  name: \"myTool\",\n  description: \"What my tool does\",\n  inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),\n  outputSchema: z.object({ result: z.string() }),\n}, async (args) => {\n  // Your logic here\n  return { result: \"Done!\" };\n});\n\n\nThe system automatically handles:\n\n * Tool registration\n * Input validation\n * Connection management\n * Error handling\n * Logging\n\nThis means you spend time building solutions that connect your AI to real business systems instead of wrestling with MCP infrastructure.\n\n\nWhat This Enables Right Now\n\nHere's what companies are already building with MCP-based systems:\n\n\nKnowledge Worker Augmentation\n\n * AI that joins your team meetings, transcribes everything, and automatically creates and assigns tasks in your project management system\n * Document processing that extracts data, validates it against business rules, and pushes it to the right systems\n * Email triage that not only categorizes messages but takes action on routine requests\n\n\nPhysical World Integration\n\n * Retail systems that coordinate between online shoppers and in-store staff for seamless pickup experiences\n * Healthcare networks where AI processes routine tests and only escalates anomalies to physicians\n * Manufacturing operations where AI analyzes quality control images and dispatches technicians when needed\n\n\nNew Business Models\n\n * On-demand expertise networks where AI handles 80% of customer inquiries and routes the rest to human specialists\n * Hybrid service offerings where AI handles routine work 24/7 while humans provide premium, personalized service\n * Marketplace platforms where AI matches supply and demand across physical and digital providers\n\n\nThe Real Question: Why Are You Still Trapped In A Text Box?\n\nThe most important statistic: 68% of digital transformation initiatives fail because they focus on the wrong things. Companies obsess over the latest AI models while ignoring the critical integration layer that connects AI to actual business operations.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will transform your business – it's whether you'll be part of the transformation or left behind. MCP isn't just another technical standard; it's the bridge between AI's theoretical potential and practical business impact.\n\nWhile others are still prompting chatbots for marginally better text, forward-thinking teams are building systems where AI and humans work together seamlessly, each handling the parts they do best. The future isn't AI replacing humans – it's integrated systems that combine AI's scalability with human judgment and expertise.\n\nThe tools are here. The market is growing exponentially. The only question is whether you'll continue treating AI as an isolated text generator or start building the connections that transform it into a business force multiplier.\n\nGet started with the WithSeismic MCP template today and stop leaving your AI trapped in a box.\n\nDoug Silkstone is the founder of WithSeismic. Find more at WithSeismic.com.\n\n\nWhat is MCP and Why Should You Care?\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) lets AI models use external tools and data. Think of it as giving AI the ability to reach beyond its text box and actually do things in the real world.\n\nHere's why that matters: AI models are great at understanding language and generating content, but they're isolated from your actual work environment. They can't natively access your databases, call your APIs, or interact with your team's tools.\n\nMCP solves this problem by creating a connection layer. When your AI needs to check JIRA tickets, send a Slack message, or query your product database, it can do that through MCP.\n\nThe excitement around MCP comes from its practical applications:\n\n * Engineers can build tools that AI can call directly\n * Teams can connect their existing systems to AI workflows\n * The same tools work across different AI interfaces (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor)\n * Custom workflows become possible without rebuilding everything\n\nIn practice, an MCP is a server that knows about your tools and makes them available to AI. When the AI needs something, it asks the MCP server to run the appropriate tool and returns the results.\n\n\nThe Next.js for Model Context Protocol: WithSeismic MCP\n\nThe problem is that building an MCP server typically requires a lot of infrastructure code. That's where the WithSeismic MCP Boilerplate comes in—it's like Next.js for MCP, abstracting away the complexity so you can focus on building tools, not infrastructure.\n\nI'm using it every day with my clients, and I want to share it so you can spin up your own server and get your team working on stuff that actually matters.\n\n\nWhat Makes This MCP Implementation Different\n\nThe existing examples for MCP are solid starting points, but they often leave you dealing with a lot of infrastructure code. I wanted something where I could just define tools and get back to building.\n\nHere's all you need to create a tool with the WithSeismic MCP:\n\nexport const myTool = new Tool({\n  name: \"myTool\",\n  description: \"What my tool does\",\n  inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),\n  outputSchema: z.object({ result: z.string() }),\n}, async (args) => {\n  // Your logic here\n  return { result: \"Done!\" };\n});\n\n\nThe system handles everything else automatically:\n\n * Tool registration\n * Input validation\n * Connection management\n * Error handling\n * Logging\n\nThis means you can spend your time building tools that solve real problems instead of wrestling with MCP infrastructure.\n\n\nBuilt for Teams, Not Just Demos\n\nI built this because more and more clients are needing something production-ready:\n\n * Robust error handling that gives useful feedback\n * A system that scales from simple tools to complex integrations\n * Performance that holds up when multiple people are using it\n * An easy learning curve that anyone with Cursor can add to.\n\n\nDeploy in Seconds, Not Days\n\nGetting started is incredibly simple:\n\n * Hit the \"Deploy on Railway\" button for instant cloud setup\n * Or run pnpm install && pnpm dev locally for development\n\nThis instant deployment means you can start building tools right away without worrying about infrastructure.\n\n\nWhat We're Building With This\n\nMy team is using this boilerplate to create tools that make our lives easier. Here are a few example ideas to get started:\n\n 1. Development tools that connect everything\n    * Pulling Jira ticket details into our AI workflows\n    * Creating branches with our naming conventions\n    * Sending Slack updates about our progress\n 2. Design and documentation flows\n    * Accessing Figma designs directly in our editor (CSS etc)\n    * Pulling in documentation as needed\n    * Updating docs as we work\n 3. Team communication made simpler\n    * Sending messages to teammates via Slack / Email without context switching\n    * Asking questions to specific teams for the bot to pick up later\n    * Creating automations for routine communication\n    * Storing new patterns and documents in Confluence.\n 4. Custom workflows for our specific needs\n    * Building tools that are unique to our company\n    * Connecting to our internal systems securely\n    * Making them available across all our AI interfaces\n\n\nGetting Started Is Incredibly Easy\n\nOne of my main goals was to make this as accessible as possible:\n\n 1. Set up your server:\n    * One click with Railway\n    * Or run locally with a single command\n 2. Connect your AI tools:\n    * Point your AI at the /sse endpoint\n    * Start using your custom tools immediately\n 3. Create what you need:\n    * Add tools in src/modules/tools/\n    * Create prompts in src/modules/prompts/\n    * Everything gets registered automatically\n\n\nWhy Build Your Own?\n\nThere are great hosted solutions like Smithery.ai out there. They're excellent services! But there are real advantages to running your own MCP server:\n\n 1. Complete control - You decide what runs and what data is accessed\n 2. Custom integration - Connect directly to your internal systems\n 3. Learning opportunity - Understand how MCPs work from the inside\n 4. Independence - No reliance on third-party services\n\n\nJoin the MCP Ecosystem\n\nI built this boilerplate because I believe in the potential of MCP to transform how we work with AI. By making it easier to create and deploy MCP servers, I hope more teams will build useful tools and share them with the community.\n\nThe current AI landscape is exciting but fragmented. MCPs provide a standardized way for models to interact with the world, and I want to help accelerate that adoption.\n\nCheck out the repo at github.com/dougwithseismic/withseismic-mcp and start building. I'd love to see what you create with it.\n\nDoug Silkstone is the founder of WithSeismic.

But what if you want the collaborative fun to continue?\n\nThis guide demonstrates how you can have the best of both worlds by building a Turborepo monorepo architecture around your Lovable application using Git submodules. This powerful approach means:\n\n * Non-technical team members can continue rapidly prototyping and iterating in the Lovable environment they're comfortable with\n * Developers can simultaneously build robust production infrastructure around the Lovable app\n * Changes sync seamlessly between environments without requiring a complete rebuild\n * Your team maintains a collaborative workflow instead of a one-time handoff\n\nThe result is a sustainable development process where everyone on your team can contribute effectively using the tools they're most productive with.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Workflow\n\nBefore diving into the technical steps, let's understand the overall workflow:\n\n 1. Lovable + GitHub branches for prototyping:\n    * Your team continues to use Lovable for rapid prototyping\n    * Changes are made on feature branches, not directly on main\n    * Pull requests are created to review changes before merging to main\n 2. Turborepo + Submodule for development:\n    * Your Lovable app exists as a Git submodule inside the Turborepo\n    * Developers can build around the app (backend, services, packages)\n    * The main app lives in the original repo, everything else is built around it\n 3. Synchronized development:\n    * Changes to Lovable can still be made through the Lovable interface\n    * Technical changes can be made by developers using Cursor or any code editor\n    * Both workflows coexist without disrupting each other\n\nThis approach gives you the freedom to continue rapid prototyping while simultaneously building production-ready infrastructure.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n * A Lovable app ready for handoff\n * Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub\n * Familiarity with monorepo concepts\n * Cursor IDE installed (recommended)\n * Node.js and pnpm installed\n\n\nStep 1: GitHub Integration for Your Lovable App\n\nSince Lovable already syncs with GitHub, focus on setting up a proper branching strategy:\n\n 1.

Ensure your app is at a handoff-ready state with clean code and documentation before proceeding.\n\nBasic workflow:\n\n# Create a new feature branch\ngit checkout -b feature/new-feature\n\n# Make your changes in Lovable or code editor\n\n# Stage your changes\ngit add .\n\n# Commit your changes\ngit commit -m \"Add new feature\"\n\n# Push your changes to GitHub\ngit push -u origin feature/new-feature\n\n\nSet up branches in your Lovable GitHub repository:\n\n# Create a development branch\ngit checkout -b development\ngit push -u origin development\n\n\n\nStep 2: Setting Up Turborepo\n\nNow that your Lovable app is properly managed in GitHub, it's time to create the production environment:\n\n 1. Open the project in Cursor IDE for enhanced development capabilities. Cursor significantly simplifies the Devops-style work we're about to do. What might have been finicky and time-consuming becomes straightforward when you know what you're trying to achieve.\n    * Delete the example apps that come with Turborepo (docs and web are Next.js examples we don't need):\n\nCreate a new Turborepo instance:\n\nnpx create-turbo@latest your-production-app\ncd your-production-app\n\n\nClean up the default setup:\n\nrm -rf apps/docs\nrm -rf apps/web\n\n\nRemember, Turborepo gives us a structured monorepo environment that will let us build around our Lovable app while maintaining clean separation of concerns.\n\n\nStep 3: Integrating Your Lovable App as a Submodule\n\n 1. What this means: You now have a reference to your Lovable app repository within your Turborepo project. This allows you to:\n    * Keep your Lovable app code separate but accessible\n    * Make changes to your Lovable app in its own repository\n    * Build additional services around your Lovable app\n 2.

You need to think carefully about your environment variables for different contexts. When deploying, make sure your production API endpoint points to your hosted backend service, not your local development machine.\n\n\nStep 6: Deployment to Railway\n\nNow it's time to get your application online through Railway.com:\n\n 1. Sign up and connect to GitHub:\n    * Create an account on Railway.com\n    * Connect your GitHub account to Railway\n    * Grant access to your repositories\n 2. Deploy your backend service:\n    * From the Railway dashboard, click \"New Project\"\n    * Select \"Deploy from GitHub repo\"\n    * Choose your Turborepo repository\n    * Configure the service to build from the apps/backend directory\n    * Set up environment variables (PORT, etc.)\n    * Deploy the service with pnpm build -F backend and pnpm start -F backend, or your Docker file etc.\n 3.

Remember that regardless of which platform you choose, the key is to properly configure your environment variables and ensure your services can communicate with each other.\n\n\nStep 7: Advanced Integration Techniques\n\n\nSharing Code Between Projects\n\nSince code within the submodule can't directly reference code outside the submodule, you have a few options:\n\n 1. Lib Directory Method:This approach works better because Lovable will do fresh installs, which would overwrite any changes to node_modules. Using a separate lib directory preserves your custom modules.\n    * Create shared packages in your Turborepo packages directory\n    * Build these packages with pnpm build\n    * Create a lib directory in your Lovable app for standalone implementations\n    * Copy the built packages to this lib directory instead of node_modules\n    * Import directly from this lib directory in your Lovable app\n 2. Use Git Hooks to automate the copy process on commit or push.\n\nAutomatic Copy Script:\n\n// scripts/copy-packages.js\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst sourceDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '../packages/shared/dist');\nconst targetDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '../apps/frontend/lib/shared');\n\n// Create target directory if it doesn't exist\nfs.mkdirSync(targetDir, { recursive: true });\n\n// Copy files\nfs.readdirSync(sourceDir).forEach(file => {\n  fs.copyFileSync(\n    path.join(sourceDir, file),\n    path.join(targetDir, file)\n  );\n});\n\nconsole.log('Packages copied successfully to lib directory');\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nTransitioning from a Lovable app to a production-ready environment using Turborepo gives you the best of both worlds: the rapid prototyping capabilities of Lovable and the robust development infrastructure of a monorepo setup.\n\nBy following this guide, you can create a seamless development workflow that allows you to continue making changes to your Lovable app while building more complex backend services and shared libraries around it.\n\nRemember that this approach is flexible - as you discover better ways to integrate your services, you can adapt your workflow to meet your specific needs.\n\n\nNeed Help?\n\nIf you need assistance getting your Lovable app production-ready, or if you have an app that you want to prepare for launch, get in touch:\n\nContact: doug@withseismic.com\n\nI've helped clients transition their impressive content generation apps from Lovable prototypes to fully production-ready applications with secure backend servers.

This isn't just about spinning up containers—it's about creating a multi-agent development ecosystem where each AI specializes in different marketing functions:\n\n * Content AI: Generates copy, headlines, and marketing messaging\n * Design AI: Creates layouts, components, and visual elements\n * SEO AI: Optimizes for search engines and performance\n * Analytics AI: Implements tracking and conversion optimization\n\n\nTechnical Brilliance: PNPM Workspace Architecture\n\nThe test reveals E2B's most impressive feature: Git worktrees with shared dependency management. This architecture achieves:\n\n\nSpace Efficiency That Scales\n\n * 90% space savings compared to separate installations\n * Shared node_modules across all AI agent workspaces\n * Smart lockfile-based installs (only when dependencies actually change)\n * 4500% estimated space savings across 50 concurrent workflows\n\n\nPerformance That Matters\n\n * Sub-second worktree creation (average 440ms in testing)\n * 39 workflows per minute sustained performance\n * 100% success rate across extensive testing\n * Intelligent package operation simulation with realistic development patterns\n\n\nThe MarTech Game-Changer\n\nThis architecture solves the fundamental problems that have plagued AI-powered site generation:\n\n\n1. Isolation Without Overhead\n\nEach AI agent gets its own workspace but shares the heavy lifting. A content AI can work on copy while a design AI modifies components, and an SEO AI optimizes meta tags—all simultaneously without conflicts.\n\n\n2. Realistic Development Simulation\n\nThe test demonstrates sophisticated package management scenarios:\n\n * 60% add operations (new marketing tools, analytics packages)\n * 20% remove operations (cleaning up unused dependencies)\n * 20% update operations (keeping frameworks current)\n\nThis mirrors real marketing site development where requirements constantly evolve.\n\n\n3. Production-Ready Architecture\n\nThe benchmark shows merge batches processing 5 workflows at a time with automatic conflict resolution. This means multiple AI agents can collaborate on complex marketing sites without human intervention for common conflicts.\n\n\nBusiness Impact for MarTech Generation\n\n\nSpeed to Market\n\n * Instant environment provisioning eliminates setup time\n * Parallel AI development accelerates feature delivery\n * Zero infrastructure management for end users\n\n\nCost Efficiency\n\n * Shared resource utilization minimizes cloud costs\n * Smart dependency management reduces bandwidth and storage\n * Automated conflict resolution eliminates developer overhead\n\n\nScalability\n\n * Multi-tenant architecture supports unlimited concurrent sites\n * Template-based provisioning ensures consistent environments\n * Resource pooling handles traffic spikes efficiently\n\n\nThe Technical Foundation\n\nThe test file demonstrates E2B's sophisticated approach to containerized development that perfectly aligns with AI agent workflows:\n\n\nBulletproof React Template Integration\n\nE2B ships with pre-configured templates like bulletproof-react that provide:\n\n * Production-ready React architecture\n * TypeScript configuration\n * Testing frameworks pre-installed\n * Build tools optimized for performance\n\n\nDynamic Agent Provisioning\n\nThe system creates specialized agent worktrees on-demand:\n\n// Feature Agent: UI/UX components\n// Bugfix Agent: Performance optimization  \n// Testing Agent: Quality assurance\n// SEO Agent: Meta tags and performance\n// Content Agent: Copy and messaging\n\n\nEach agent gets isolated git branches but shared dependencies, enabling parallel development without conflicts.\n\n\nReal-World Package Simulation\n\nThe test includes realistic package pools that mirror marketing site requirements:\n\n * Utility packages: lodash, date-fns, uuid (common in marketing tools)\n * Dev tools: Prettier, ESLint (code quality)\n * Testing frameworks: Vitest, Testing Library (reliability)\n\n\nWhy This Changes Everything for MarTech\n\n\nTraditional Challenges Solved\n\nProblem: Marketing teams need custom sites but lack technical resources. E2B Solution: AI agents handle all technical complexity while sharing efficient infrastructure.\n\nProblem: Development environments are slow to provision and expensive to maintain. E2B Solution: Sub-second provisioning with shared resource pools.\n\nProblem: Multiple developers (or AI agents) create conflicts when working simultaneously. E2B Solution: Git worktrees provide isolation with automatic merge strategies.\n\n\nThe Competitive Advantage\n\nThis architecture enables a no-code marketing site generator to:\n\n 1. Generate complex sites in minutes instead of weeks\n 2. Support unlimited simultaneous users through resource sharing\n 3. Maintain production quality through proven templates and testing\n 4. Scale economically with shared infrastructure costs\n\n\nPerformance Metrics That Matter\n\nThe test results speak volumes:\n\n * 1.24 second average workflow time (setup to cleanup)\n * Smart dependency management avoids unnecessary installs 95% of the time\n * Automatic conflict resolution handles merge scenarios without human intervention\n * Sub-10-second full site generation for complex marketing sites\n\n\nThe Future of MarTech Development\n\nE2B represents a fundamental shift from traditional hosting to intelligent development orchestration. For a no-code LLM marketing site generator, this means:\n\n\nImmediate Benefits\n\n * Zero setup time for end users\n * Instant preview environments for every change\n * Collaborative AI development with specialized agents\n * Production-ready outputs from day one\n\n\nLong-term Advantages\n\n * Ecosystem compatibility with any framework or tool\n * Infinite scalability through cloud-native architecture\n * Cost predictability through shared resource utilization\n * Quality assurance through automated testing and validation\n\n\nConclusion: The Decision is Clear\n\nAfter analyzing this comprehensive test suite, E2B emerges as the obvious choice for powering a no-code LLM marketing site generator.
