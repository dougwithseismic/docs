## Overview

This assessment framework helps agencies systematically evaluate their services to identify the best productization opportunities. Use this framework to make data-driven decisions about where to invest your product development resources.

## Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Service Inventory

**Step 1: Complete Service List**
Create a comprehensive list of all services your agency provides. Include:
- Core service offerings
- Add-on services
- Internal processes that clients value
- Consulting methodologies
- Tools and templates you've developed

**Step 2: Service Documentation**
For each service, document:
- Detailed process steps
- Time investment required
- Resources needed
- Typical client outcomes
- Pricing model
- Frequency of delivery

**Step 3: Client Value Mapping**
Identify the specific value each service provides:
- Problems it solves
- Outcomes it enables
- Time it saves clients
- Revenue it generates for clients
- Costs it reduces for clients

### Phase 2: Opportunity Scoring

Use this scoring matrix to evaluate each service across five key dimensions. Rate each on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is the highest score.

#### 1. Market Demand (Weight: 25%)

**Frequency of Requests (1-5)**
- 1: Rarely requested (< 2 times per year)
- 2: Occasionally requested (2-4 times per year)
- 3: Regularly requested (5-10 times per year)
- 4: Frequently requested (11-20 times per year)
- 5: Constantly requested (20+ times per year)

**Market Size (1-5)**
- 1: Very niche market (< 100 potential customers)
- 2: Small market (100-500 potential customers)
- 3: Medium market (500-2,000 potential customers)
- 4: Large market (2,000-10,000 potential customers)
- 5: Very large market (10,000+ potential customers)

**Urgency Level (1-5)**
- 1: Nice to have, low urgency
- 2: Somewhat important, can be delayed
- 3: Important, moderate urgency
- 4: High priority, urgent need
- 5: Critical, immediate need

**Market Demand Score = (Frequency + Market Size + Urgency) ÷ 3**

#### 2. Differentiation (Weight: 20%)

**IP Protection Potential (1-5)**
- 1: Cannot be protected
- 2: Limited protection possible
- 3: Some protectable elements
- 4: Significant protection potential

**Differentiation Score = (Methodology + Competitive Advantage + IP Protection) ÷ 3**

#### 3. Scalability (Weight: 25%)

**Automation Potential (1-5)**
- 1: Requires full human involvement
- 2: Some tasks can be automated
- 3: Significant automation possible
- 4: Mostly automatable

**Resource Requirements (1-5)**
- 1: High ongoing resource needs
- 2: Moderate ongoing resources
- 3: Some ongoing resources needed
- 4: Minimal ongoing resources
- 5: No ongoing resources required

**Scalability Score = (Automation + Standardization + (6 - Resource Requirements)) ÷ 3**

#### 4. Technical Feasibility (Weight: 15%)

**Development Complexity (1-5)**
- 1: Extremely complex development required
- 2: Complex development needed
- 3: Moderate development complexity
- 4: Simple development required
- 5: Very simple or no development needed

**Technical Resources Available (1-5)**
- 1: No technical capabilities in-house
- 2: Limited technical resources
- 3: Some technical capabilities

- 2: 6-12 months to develop
- 3: 3-6 months to develop
- 4: 1-3 months to develop
- 5: Less than 1 month to develop

**Technical Feasibility Score = (Development Complexity + Technical Resources + Time to Market) ÷ 3**

#### 5. Revenue Potential (Weight: 15%)

**Pricing Power (1-5)**
- 1: Low pricing potential
- 2: Below-average pricing
- 3: Market-rate pricing
- 4: Premium pricing potential
- 5: Exceptional pricing power

**Revenue Model Strength (1-5)**
- 1: One-time purchase only
- 2: Limited recurring potential
- 3: Some recurring elements
- 4: Strong recurring model
- 5: Subscription/platform model

**Market Expansion Potential (1-5)**
- 1: Limited to current clients
- 2: Small expansion potential
- 3: Moderate expansion opportunity
- 4: Significant expansion potential
- 5: Massive market opportunity

**Revenue Potential Score = (Pricing Power + Revenue Model + Market Expansion) ÷ 3**

### Phase 3: Composite Scoring

Calculate the weighted composite score for each opportunity:

**Composite Score = (Market Demand × 0.25) + (Differentiation × 0.20) + (Scalability × 0.25) + (Technical Feasibility × 0.15) + (Revenue Potential × 0.15)**

### Phase 4: Prioritization Matrix

Plot each opportunity on a matrix with two dimensions:

**X-Axis: Composite Score (1-5)**
**Y-Axis: Strategic Fit (1-5)**

Strategic fit considers:
- Alignment with agency vision
- Team expertise and interest
- Client relationship impact
- Brand positioning effects

#### Priority Quadrants:

**High Score, High Fit (Upper Right)**
- Priority 1: Immediate development candidates
- Strong business case and strategic alignment
- Allocate primary resources here

**High Score, Low Fit (Lower Right)**
- Priority 2: Consider with caution
- Strong business potential but misaligned
- May require strategic pivots

**Low Score, High Fit (Upper Left)**
- Priority 3: Future consideration
- Good strategic fit but weak business case
- Monitor for changing conditions

**Low Score, Low Fit (Lower Left)**
- Priority 4: Avoid
- Neither strong business case nor strategic fit
- Deprioritize completely

## Conclusion

This assessment framework provides a systematic approach to evaluating productization opportunities. Remember that scores are not absolute - they represent relative rankings to help prioritize your limited resources.

The framework should be customized to your agency's specific situation, market position, and strategic objectives. Regular reassessment ensures your productization strategy remains aligned with changing market conditions and business priorities.

Use this framework as a starting point for data-driven product development decisions, but don't let it replace strategic thinking and market intuition. The best productization opportunities often combine strong quantitative scores with compelling qualitative factors that may not be fully captured in any scoring system.
