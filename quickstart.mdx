## Is automation right for your business?

This self-assessment helps you determine if you're ready to eliminate repetitive work and transform your operations through intelligent automation.

### Step 1: Identify your productization opportunity

<Accordion icon="brain" title="The Automation Readiness Self-Assessment">
  Answer these questions honestly about your business:

**1. What process do you repeat regularly?**

- Customer analysis?
- Vendor onboarding?
- Performance reporting?
- Data processing?
- Quality checks?
- Market research?

**2. What deliverable takes the most time but follows a pattern?**

- Reports that follow templates?
- Analyses with consistent methodology?
- Recommendations based on set criteria?

**3. What expertise or process delivers consistent value?**

- Your specific framework?
- Your unique approach?
- Your proprietary process?

**If you answered yes to any of these, you have an automation opportunity.**

✅ **GOOD CANDIDATES**:

- "We run the same analysis process for every customer segment"
- "Our vendor onboarding follows the exact same 20 steps"
- "We spend 10 hours weekly generating the same reports"
- "Our team manually processes data that follows clear patterns"
- "We repeatedly answer the same customer questions"

❌ **NOT READY YET**:

- "Every situation is completely unique"
- "We're still figuring out our processes"
- "We change our approach constantly"
- "There's no pattern to our work"

<Warning>
If you can't identify at least one repeatable process that delivers value, you need to establish clear workflows before automating.
