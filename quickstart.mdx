## How to productize your agency services

We only work with agencies ready to escape the time-for-money trap. This page helps you determine if productization is right for you and how to get started with WithSeismic.

### Step 1: Identify your productization opportunity

<Accordion icon="brain" title="The Productization Self-Assessment">
  Answer these questions honestly about your agency:

**1. What process do you repeat for every client?**
- SEO audits?
- Conversion assessments?
- Strategy frameworks?
- Campaign planning?

**2. What deliverable takes the most time but follows a pattern?**
- Reports that follow templates?
- Analyses with consistent methodology?
- Recommendations based on set criteria?

**3. What expertise do clients pay for repeatedly?**
- Your specific framework?
- Your unique approach?
- Your proprietary process?

**If you answered yes to any of these, you have a productization opportunity.**

✅ **GOOD CANDIDATES**:
- "We run the same 50-point SEO audit for every client"
- "Our conversion optimization framework is our secret sauce"
- "Clients pay us $5K/month to monitor the same metrics"

❌ **NOT READY YET**:
- "Every project is completely custom"
- "We're still figuring out our process"
- "We do whatever the client needs"

  <Warning>
    If you can't identify at least one repeatable process that clients value, you need to develop your methodology first before productizing.
  </Warning>

### Step 2: Reach out for a productization consultation
