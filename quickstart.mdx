## How to get your interactive tool built

We only take on projects where we can deliver 10x value. This page helps you qualify yourself in and get straight to Doug and the team. Takes 3 minutes, saves everyone weeks.

### Step 1: Watch this first (2 min)

<Accordion icon="brain" title="Now do the brutally honest value prop exercise">
  After watching the video, forget the marketing speak. We need the real story.

Fill in this statement with brutal honesty:

**"[Company name] helps [specific audience] do [specific thing] because [honest reason why it matters]."**

Examples of what we're looking for:

‚úÖ **GOOD**: "Datadog helps DevOps teams monitor infrastructure because downtime costs $5,000/minute and our alerts are 3x faster than checking manually."

‚ùå **BAD**: "We're revolutionizing the future of work with AI-powered synergistic solutions."

‚úÖ **GOOD**: "Stripe helps developers accept payments because integrating payment systems from scratch takes 6 months and breaks constantly."

‚ùå **BAD**: "We deliver best-in-class payment experiences."

  <Warning>
    If you can't explain your value in one sentence that would make your ideal customer say "holy shit, I need that," we need to figure that out first.
  </Warning>

### Step 2: Reach out to Doug directly

<Accordion icon="envelope" title="Copy this template and send it to Doug">
  If you've done the work in Step 1 and know we're a fit, copy this template and send to **hello@withseismic.com**. Doug reads every email personally:

```
Subject: Interactive Tool Request - [Your Company]

Our value prop:
[Company] helps [audience] do [thing] because [reason].

The problem:
Our prospects don't understand [specific aspect] until [too late in the process].

What we think might work:
An interactive [calculator/demo/comparison tool] that shows [specific value].

Our timeline:
We need this by [date] because [business reason].

Budget range:
[ ] $6K (2-week sprint)
[ ] $12K (4-week sprint)
[ ] Let's discuss
```

  <Tip>
    The more specific you are about the problem, the better solution we can build. Don't worry about having all the answers‚Äîthat's what the discovery call is for.
  </Tip>

## What happens when Doug says yes

If we agree we can 10x your conversion rate:

1. **15-minute chemistry check with Doug** - Can we work together at the speed required?
2. **90-minute discovery workshop** - Doug maps your exact conversion blocker and designs the solution
3. **The team starts building** - You see working code within 48 hours
4. **You ship your tool** - 2-4 weeks later, it's live and generating pipeline
