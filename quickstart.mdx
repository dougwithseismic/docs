## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do I need to prepare for our discovery call?">
    Just come ready to discuss your most frustrating manual processes. We'll help you identify which workflows waste the most time and would benefit most from automation. No technical preparation needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to see results?">
    Most clients have working prototypes within 2 weeks and see full ROI within 4-6 months. The tools we build start saving time from day one of deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my processes are too complex for automation?">
    Complex processes are perfect for our LLM-powered automation. Our systems understand context and handle nuanced workflows that traditional automation can't.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need technical expertise on my team?">
    No. We build tools that your non-technical team can use immediately. Training typically takes 5-10 minutes per person. If it's more complicated than that, we've failed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's included in the project requirements assessment?">
    We help you understand what makes a business ready for automation - identifying processes worth automating, calculating potential ROI, and determining if your team is ready for the transformation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you automate processes that involve multiple tools?">
    Yes. Most valuable automation connects multiple tools and platforms. We excel at building bridges between systems that weren't designed to work together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if we're not ready to commit to a full project?">
    The discovery call is a no-pressure conversation to explore possibilities. Many clients start with our 2-week sprint ($12K) to test the approach before committing to larger transformations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from no-code automation tools?">
    No-code tools work for simple workflows but fail with complexity. We build custom solutions that handle your specific processes, edge cases, and business logic that generic tools can't.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if our processes change after automation?">
    Our tools are built to be flexible and maintainable. We can adjust workflows as your business evolves. Most changes take hours or days to implement, not weeks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you work with companies outside the US?">
    Yes, we work with clients globally. Our development process is designed for remote collaboration, and we've successfully delivered projects across different time zones.
