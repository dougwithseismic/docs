# Automation Discovery

**$6,000 • 2 Weeks • Skunkworks Design Sprint**

Before you can build the impossible, you need to reimagine what's possible. Our Automation Discovery is a two-week skunkworks sprint where we identify your biggest bottlenecks and design automation solutions that shouldn't exist but will transform your operations.

## What We Audit

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Analytics & Tracking">
    ### Foundation for Intelligent Automation

    We audit your entire data infrastructure to identify automation opportunities:

    - **Data Flow Mapping**: How does information move through your systems?
    - **Decision Points**: Where can AI make better decisions than humans?
    - **Integration Opportunities**: What systems should talk but don't?
    - **Intelligence Gaps**: Where could automation think for you?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Marketing Systems">
    ### Impossible Automation Opportunities

    We identify where creative automation can transform your operations:

    - **Autonomous Systems**: What could run itself with zero human input?
    - **Distributed Networks**: How could users become part of your system?
    - **AI Workflows**: Where can LLMs process at inhuman speeds?
    - **Skunkworks Projects**: What moonshot could change everything?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Product & Retention">
    ### User Experience & Stickiness

    We analyze how users interact with your product:

    - **Onboarding Flow**: Time to first value
    - **Feature Adoption**: Which features drive retention
    - **Engagement Metrics**: Daily/weekly/monthly active users
    - **Churn Prevention**: Why users leave and how to stop it
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Automation">
    ### Build What Shouldn't Exist

    We identify impossible solutions that would transform your business:

    - **Moonshot Mapping**: Document impossible ideas worth building
    - **Creative Engineering**: Solutions that break conventional thinking
    - **Autonomous Operations**: Systems that manage themselves
    - **Transformation Potential**: Impact of building the impossible
  </Tab>
