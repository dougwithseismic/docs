## The Agency Landscape Has Changed Forever

<Info>
  **2025 marks a watershed moment**: AI isn't coming—it's here, and it's
  fundamentally restructuring how professional services are percieved, even if
  the outputs can be lackluster.

  <Card title="The Existential Question" icon="brain">
    Every agency, consultancy, and independent professional now faces the same
    question: **Do we compete as a labor business or an intelligence business?**
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Economic Reality" icon="chart-line">
    The traditional service model—billing hours for human labor—is becoming
    **economically untenable**. Clients are questioning premium pricing, having

### What's Actually Happening
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client Perspective">
    <Icon icon="user" />
    Clients with ChatGPT can now do in minutes what junior staff used to do in days.
    They're questioning why they should pay $200/hour for work an LLM can approximate
    for pennies. **And they're not wrong to ask.**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Professional Perspective">
    <Icon icon="code" />
    As a software engineer who built a reputation on deep technical expertise, I've
    felt this shift personally. The IP and knowledge that used to be my biggest barrier
    to competition is now under fire—not because it's devalued, but because the baseline
    has shifted dramatically. Anyone with ChatGPT can now build basic features and
    deliver simple solutions. The CRUD apps, landing pages, and standard integrations
    that used to command premium rates? They're commoditized. This forces me to compete
    only on increasingly complex work—distributed systems, real-time architectures,
    sophisticated automations—which means higher costs, longer timelines, and fewer
    qualified prospects. The irony? Clients expect the same turnaround times and
    budgets they got for simple work, because "AI makes everything faster, right?"
    Meanwhile, I'm spending more time educating them on why their "ChatGPT said this
    would be easy" project actually requires deep expertise. It's exhausting defending
    value that used to be self-evident.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Market Reality">
    <Icon icon="globe" />
    The belief that "anyone can do what you do for a fraction of the price" isn't
    entirely wrong—**for the commodity work**. The differentiation now comes from
    systems, not just skills.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
**The agencies that will thrive** won't be the ones that compete with AI.
They'll be the ones that **build intelligent systems** around their expertise,
turning their methodologies into scalable products that deliver consistent value
at marginal cost.

## The Reality Check
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
if (window.WithSeismicTracker) {
  window.WithSeismicTracker.captureInterest('agency-reality');
}
`,
  }}
/>
Let's be honest about how agencies spend their time:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Information Gathering" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **30% of time** - Collecting data from multiple sources, compiling research,
    building context
  </Card>
  <Card title="Processing & Analysis" icon="chart-line">
    **25% of time** - Turning raw information into insights, identifying
    patterns, drawing conclusions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production & Formatting" icon="file-lines">
    **20% of time** - Creating deliverables, formatting reports, building
    presentations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communication Overhead" icon="comments">
    **15% of time** - Status updates, meeting notes, email drafts, project
    management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<Note>
  **The shocking reality**: Only 10% is actual strategic thinking—the work
  clients believe they're paying for. If you'll believe the marketing hype, LLMs
  can now handle 70-80% of the rest, often better than humans. Whether or not
  true, prospects are choosing to believe it.
</Note>
This distribution hasn't changed in 20 years. What has changed is that LLMs can now
handle most of this work—and often do it better than humans. They don't get tired.
They don't miss patterns. They don't forget to check something. The agencies still
operating like it's 2019 are about to learn a harsh lesson: Clients won't pay premium
prices for commodity work that AI can do. But the agencies building intelligent systems
around their expertise? They're about to experience unprecedented growth.

## Why I'm Building Tools

Productization isn't about building software products. It's about
recognizing that your true value isn't in the hours you bill—it's in the intelligence,
methodologies, and frameworks you've developed. And in 2025, those assets need to
be encoded into systems, not trapped in people's heads.
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
if (window.WithSeismicTracker) {
  window.WithSeismicTracker.captureInterest('productization');
}
`,
  }}
/>
<snippet file="company-calculator.mdx" />

I learned this the hard way. My expertise
spans the intersection of product, marketing, and engineering—I know how to build
automated revenue systems using code. But explaining this value to clients who think
"AI can do it cheaper" became exhausting.

So I started building tools instead. The
calculators, widgets, and embeds you see throughout this documentation? They're proof
points. They demonstrate expertise in ways that can't be replicated by someone with
ChatGPT.

Consider what's happening right now:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Your competition isn't other agencies">
    It's every client with access to Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini. They're already
    using AI to do work they used to outsource. The question isn't whether
    they'll replace more service work with AI—it's how fast it will happen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your methodologies are your moat">
    That proprietary framework you've refined over years? The unique approach to
    solving client problems? Those are valuable. But if they only exist in
    Google Docs and your collective knowledge, they're not defensible. Anyone
    can copy a process. No one can copy a system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your clients want outcomes, not hours">
    The billable hour is dying because clients have realized they were never
    buying time—they were buying results. Productized services deliver
    predictable outcomes at predictable costs. That's what clients actually
    want.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Differentiation requires demonstration">
    You can't just claim expertise anymore—you need to show it through tools
    that deliver immediate value. When prospects can use your calculator or
    assessment tool, they experience your expertise before they buy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How LLMs Enable True Productization

Previous attempts at agency productization
failed because they could only automate the simple stuff. Templates, workflows, project
management. The actual work—the thinking, analysis, and creativity—still required
humans.

LLMs changed the game entirely. They can:
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
if (window.WithSeismicTracker) {
  window.WithSeismicTracker.captureInterest('llm-capabilities');
}
`,
  }}
/>
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Understand Context">
    Unlike traditional automation, LLMs understand nuance. They can adapt to
    different client contexts, industry specifics, and unique requirements
    without being explicitly programmed for each scenario.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Process Unstructured Data">
    Agencies deal with messy, unstructured information constantly. LLMs can
    parse emails, analyze documents, extract insights from conversations, and
    synthesize findings from disparate sources—work that was impossible to
    automate before.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Generate Original Output">
    Not just filling in templates, but creating genuinely useful first drafts,
    analyses, and recommendations. The output still needs human refinement, but
    the heavy lifting is automated.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Learn and Improve">
    Every interaction makes the system smarter. Your prompts get refined. Your
    processes get optimized. The system learns your agency's specific approach
    and gets better at replicating it.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This isn't theoretical. Agencies are already using LLM-powered systems to:

- Process 800+ information sources simultaneously (see our Fingers on the Pulse case study)
- Generate comprehensive competitive analyses in 15 minutes instead of 2 days
- Create first drafts of strategy documents that capture 80% of the final output
- Automate quality checks that catch more errors than manual review

## The Three Stages of Agency Evolution
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Stage 1: Internal Augmentation">
    <Icon icon="rocket" />
    **Where most agencies should start** Build LLM-powered tools that make your existing
    team 5-10x more productive. Don't change your service model—just deliver it more
    efficiently.
    <Check>Automated research and information gathering</Check>
    <Check>First-draft generation for deliverables</Check>
    <Check>Intelligent quality assurance</Check>
    <Check>Smart project documentation</Check>
    <Tip>
      This stage alone can double margins while improving quality and reducing
      burnout.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stage 2: Service Productization">
    <Icon icon="layer-group" />
    **The multiplication effect** Package your augmented capabilities into standardized
    offerings. Same expertise, new delivery model.
    <Check>Self-service tools for smaller clients</Check>
    <Check>Automated audits and assessments</Check>
    <Check>Intelligent dashboards and insights</Check>
    <Check>Subscription-based advisory services</Check>
    <Tip>Now you're serving 10x more clients with the same team.</Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stage 3: Platform Creation">
    <Icon icon="globe" />
    **The endgame** Your internal tools become the platform others build on. You're
    no longer selling services—you're selling access to intelligent systems.
    <Check>White-label your tools to other agencies</Check>
    <Check>License your methodologies as AI models</Check>
    <Check>Build marketplaces around your expertise</Check>
    <Check>Create ecosystems others participate in</Check>
    <Tip>
      This is where agencies become software companies with 10-20x valuations.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

## Real Examples from the Field
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content Intelligence at Scale">
    **Challenge**: An ed-tech company needed to monitor 800+ YouTube channels to
    stay current with industry trends. **Traditional approach**: Team of 5
    researchers, 60% of their time just gathering information, still missing
    critical updates. **Productized solution**: LLM system that processes
    thousands of hours of content, extracts insights, identifies trends. Same
    work, 200x faster. **Result**: Content lag reduced from months to hours.
    Research time cut by 75%. Team focused on creating education, not gathering
    information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SEO Audit Automation">
    **Challenge**: Digital agency spending 2 days per client on comprehensive
    SEO audits. **Traditional approach**: Manual checklist with 200+ items,
    multiple tools, extensive documentation. **Productized solution**: Automated
    system that runs all checks, analyzes results with LLMs, generates
    client-ready reports. **Result**: Audits delivered in 2 hours instead of 2
    days. Junior staff can deliver senior-quality work. Audit becomes a product,
    not a service.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Strategic Planning Acceleration">
    **Challenge**: Strategy consultancy taking 3 weeks to develop comprehensive
    strategic plans. **Traditional approach**: Extensive research, stakeholder
    interviews, framework application, document creation. **Productized
    solution**: LLM-powered system that processes inputs, applies frameworks,
    generates draft strategies for human refinement. **Result**: First draft in
    3 days instead of 3 weeks. Consultants focus on refinement and client
    interaction. Capacity doubled without hiring.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why Service Providers Struggle with This Transition

### The Expertise Paradox

Your best people—the ones who really understand your methodologies—are too busy
delivering client work to build systems. Meanwhile, developers don't understand
the nuances of your approach well enough to encode it properly. You need
builders who understand both service delivery and AI capabilities.

I face this myself at WithSeismic. The deep expertise that lets me build automated revenue
systems is the same expertise I need to encode into tools. But every hour
building tools is an hour not billing clients. The solution? Build
incrementally, starting with the smallest valuable piece.

### The Investment Dilemma

Every hour spent on internal tools is an hour not billed to clients. In
the short term, productization looks like a cost center. But this is like saying
"we're too busy cutting wood to sharpen the saw." The agencies that make this
investment now will dominate the next decade.

### The Culture Challenge

Many service professionals see AI as a threat to their livelihood. They're not wrong
if they keep operating the old way. But in a productized model, AI makes their
work more valuable, not less. They stop doing grunt work and start doing the
high-value activities that justified their expertise in the first place.

The shift requires embracing a new identity: You're not selling time, you're selling
systems. You're not a service provider, you're a solution architect who happens
to deliver through tools.

### The Technical Gap

Most agencies don't have the technical capabilities to build LLM-powered systems. They can barely maintain
their website, let alone build intelligent automation. This is why partnerships
with specialized builders (like WithSeismic) make sense—you need expertise you
don't have and can't afford to develop internally.

## The Path Forward: Start Where You Are
<Info>
  **The 80/20 rule of productization**: 80% of the value comes from automating
  20% of your processes. You don't need to automate everything—just the stuff
  that actually wastes time.
</Info>
<snippet file="email-capture.mdx" />

You don't need to transform overnight. Start with one painful, repetitive process
that everyone hates. Build a tool that automates it. Use it internally. Refine it
based on real usage. Then expand.

### The 8-Week Roadmap
<Steps>
  <Step title="Week 1-2: Discovery">
    Identify and map the most painful repetitive process. Interview your team.
    Document the current workflow. Calculate time spent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 3-4: Build MVP">
    Build a basic automation that handles 80% of cases. Don't aim for
    perfection. Focus on the happy path.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 5-6: Add Intelligence">
    Refine based on actual usage. Add LLM capabilities. Handle edge cases.
    Improve the UI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 7-8: Deploy Internally">
    Package for internal deployment. Train your team. Document the process.
    Gather feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Month 3-4: Scale">
    Consider external productization once internally proven. Add payment
    processing. Build marketing site.
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Check>
  This incremental approach de-risks the investment and shows immediate ROI.
</Check>
## The Competitive Reality
<Warning>
  **Time is running out**: The window to transform your agency is closing. Every
  month you wait, AI-native competitors gain ground.
</Warning>
Let's be crystal clear about what's happening:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clients Using AI" icon="robot" color="#ea5a0c">
    They're experimenting with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. They're discovering
    they can do some agency work themselves. This will accelerate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Native Competition" icon="bolt" color="#dc2626">
    Starting with 10x productivity advantages because they built on AI from day
    one. They undercut your prices while maintaining higher margins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Death of Billable Hours" icon="clock" color="#0285c7">
    Clients reject time-based billing because they see AI doing in minutes what
    agencies charge hours for. Value pricing requires unique value.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Talent Expectations" icon="users" color="#8b5cf6">
    The best people won't join agencies doing repetitive work. They want
    strategic, creative work. Can't offer that? Can't attract talent.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
## The Questions That Matter
<Accordion title="What happens when clients can get 70% quality from AI?">
  This is already happening for many agency services. Clients are using ChatGPT
  for content creation, Claude for analysis, and Gemini for research. If you're
  not offering something AI can't replicate, you're already losing business—you
  just might not know it yet.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much time does your team spend on patterned work?">
  If it's more than 50%, you're sitting on massive efficiency gains. Every
  repetitive task is an opportunity for automation. Every template is a
  potential product. Every framework could be a tool.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if each person could handle 5x more clients?">
  This is what LLM augmentation enables. Imagine your current team serving 5x
  the clients with better quality and less stress. That's not theoretical—it's
  happening at AI-augmented agencies right now.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if you had 70% margins instead of 30%?">
  Productized agencies achieve this because their marginal cost approaches zero.
  Once the tool is built, serving 10 clients costs the same as serving 1000.
  That's the power of productization.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What could you build without drowning in repetitive work?">
  This is the real opportunity—not just efficiency, but innovation. When your
  team isn't buried in grunt work, they can focus on creating new value,
  exploring new markets, and building the future of your business.
</Accordion>

## The Choice Is Yours

The professional services landscape has bifurcated. There
are two paths:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Path 1: The Slow Decline" icon="trend-down" color="#dc2626">
    - Keep operating like it's 2019 - Bill hours for work AI can do - Watch
    clients leave for AI tools - Compete on price in a race to the bottom - Hope
    things somehow work out
  </Card>
  <Card title="Path 2: The Transformation" icon="trend-up" color="#16a34a">
    - Build intelligent systems around expertise - Turn methodologies into
    scalable products - Create a portfolio approach - Let AI handle the grunt
    work - Compete on unique value, not time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The professionals choosing Path 2 aren't just surviving—they're experiencing
unprecedented growth. They're serving more clients, delivering better results,
and building valuable IP assets. Most importantly, they're energized instead of
burned out.

For me, this means offering both: High-ticket consulting for complex
automated revenue systems that require deep expertise, and a growing suite of
tools that demonstrate that expertise while serving clients who can't afford the
full engagement. The tools become both lead generation and revenue
diversification.

The technology exists. The playbook is proven. The only
question is whether you'll act before it's too late.
