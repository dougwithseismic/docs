## Transform Your Expertise Into Lead-Generating Assessment Tools

Your agency has frameworks, methodologies, and evaluation processes that consistently deliver results for clients. WithSeismic helps you package that expertise into interactive assessment tools that work 24/7—qualifying prospects, demonstrating value, and generating leads while you sleep.

## What Are Agency Assessment Tools?

Assessment tools are interactive products that guide prospects through your evaluation frameworks, providing them with valuable insights while showcasing your expertise. Instead of manually conducting the same discovery process with every prospect, your assessment tool does it automatically.

**Common Assessment Tool Types:**
- **Business Maturity Assessments** - Evaluate where companies stand in their growth journey
- **Digital Readiness Audits** - Assess a company's technology stack and digital capabilities
- **Marketing Performance Reviews** - Analyze current marketing efforts and identify opportunities
- **Security Vulnerability Scans** - Evaluate cybersecurity posture and compliance gaps
- **Process Efficiency Evaluations** - Identify operational bottlenecks and improvement areas
- **Strategy Alignment Checks** - Assess how well current initiatives align with business goals

## How WithSeismic Builds Assessment Tools

**Step 1: Framework Analysis**
We work with your team to document the questions, criteria, and decision trees you use when evaluating client situations. What makes a good prospect? What red flags do you look for? How do you prioritize recommendations?

**Step 2: Interactive Design**
We transform your framework into an engaging, multi-step experience. Users answer questions, receive immediate feedback, and get progressively more invested in the process as they move through your assessment.

**Step 3: Intelligent Scoring**
We build sophisticated scoring algorithms that mirror your expert judgment. The tool doesn't just collect answers—it interprets them using your methodology to provide meaningful insights and recommendations.

**Step 4: Value-Driven Results**
Every assessment concludes with a comprehensive report that demonstrates your expertise while identifying specific opportunities for improvement. Users receive genuine value while you capture qualified leads.

## Key Features We Build Into Every Assessment Tool

**Progressive Disclosure**
Start with simple questions to build engagement, then dive deeper as users become invested. Each section reveals new insights based on previous answers.

**Dynamic Recommendations**
Results adapt based on user responses. A small business gets different recommendations than an enterprise, even if they have similar challenges.

**Visual Results Dashboard**
Present findings through charts, scores, and visual reports that are easy to understand and share internally.

**Lead Qualification Integration**
Automatically score and route qualified prospects to your sales team with complete context about their needs and challenges.

Every assessment tool is fully branded as yours. Your logo, colors, voice, and methodology—WithSeismic remains invisible to your prospects.

Use assessments on your website, in email campaigns, as sales tools, or embedded in partner sites.
