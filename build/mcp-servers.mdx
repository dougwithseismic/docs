## Connect AI Directly to Your Business Systems

<Info>
  **The game changer**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI assistants directly access your business systems. No more copy-pasting. No more context switching. Just intelligent automation with full system access.
</Info>

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is Anthropic's new standard for connecting LLMs to external tools and data sources. Instead of copy-pasting between ChatGPT and your systems, MCP servers enable AI assistants to directly interact with your databases, APIs, and business logic -- transforming them from chat interfaces into automation powerhouses.

## What Are MCP Servers?

MCP servers are lightweight connectors that bridge AI assistants (like Claude Desktop) with your business systems. They expose your tools and data as functions that AI can call directly, enabling:

- **Direct Database Access**: AI reads and writes to your database
- **API Integration**: LLMs interact with any REST or GraphQL API
- **Tool Execution**: AI runs scripts, queries, and automations
- **Real-Time Data**: Fresh data access without manual updates
- **Secure Context**: Controlled access with proper authentication

Think of it as giving your AI assistant API keys to your entire tech stack -- but with guardrails, permissions, and audit trails.

## Why MCP Changes Everything

## The Future of Work with MCP

MCP servers represent a fundamental shift in how we interact with AI. Instead of AI being a sophisticated chatbot, it becomes an intelligent agent that can:

- Execute complex multi-step workflows
- Maintain context across all your systems
- Learn from your business patterns
- Scale your expertise infinitely

This amplifies human capabilities 100x rather than replacing people.
