## What Are Internal Tools?

Internal tools are custom software solutions that automate and systematize your company's workflows, quality standards, and decision-making processes. Instead of relying on individual expertise and tribal knowledge, you create scalable systems that work consistently regardless of who's executing the work.

**Internal Tool Categories:**
- **Process Automation Tools** -- Standardize and automate repetitive workflows
- **Quality Assurance Systems** -- Ensure consistent output quality across all operations
- **Resource Planning Platforms** -- Optimize team allocation and capacity management
- **Customer Onboarding Systems** -- Standardize how you onboard customers, vendors, or partners
- **Decision Support Tools** -- Codify business logic and approval processes
- **Knowledge Management Systems** -- Capture and share expertise across your organization
