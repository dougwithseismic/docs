## Turn Repetitive Knowledge Work Into Intelligent Automation

<Info>
**What can LLM workflows automate that traditional automation can't?**
LLM workflows handle complex, context-aware tasks like analyzing content, understanding nuance, and making intelligent decisions - processing at 200x the speed of manual work.
</Info>

<Info>
  **The evolution**: After a decade building automation for brands, LLMs finally solved the challenge that deterministic code couldn't touch - intelligent, context-aware processing at scale.
</Info>

Your team spends hours on tasks that require intelligence but follow patterns: analyzing content, extracting insights, generating reports. Traditional automation breaks when it hits anything requiring understanding or judgment.

LLM workflows combine engineering principles - queuing, caching, retry mechanisms - with AI's ability to understand context, transforming manual processes that would be "too grandiose" to automate traditionally.

## What Are LLM Workflows?

<Info>
**How do LLM workflows differ from regular automation?**
Traditional automation breaks with any variation. LLM workflows understand context, adapt to nuance, and handle complexity - like understanding actual urgency based on business context, not just keywords.
</Info>

LLM workflows are intelligent automation systems that combine the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with programmatic execution. Unlike traditional automation that breaks with any variation, LLM workflows understand context, adapt to nuance, and handle complexity.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traditional Automation">
    <Icon icon="robot" />
    If field contains "urgent" then flag as priority. Breaks with any variation. Can't handle nuance. Requires exact matches.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LLM Workflow">
    <Icon icon="brain" />
    Understand the actual urgency based on context, client history, and business impact. Adapts to variations. Handles complexity.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The 200x Speed Advantage

<Info>
**What kind of ROI can I expect from LLM workflows?**
Our Fingers on Pulse case study processes content auditing in under an hour versus weeks manually - achieving 200x speed improvements with better accuracy than human analysis.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Fingers on Pulse case study**: Channel content auditing that would take weeks manually now happens in under an hour. LLMs extract tech stacks, identify educational value, detect product placements - aggregating many datasets into unified insights.
</Warning>

- Ensuring consistent quality
- Building maintainable systems

## The Future of Knowledge Work

LLM workflows eliminate the parts of knowledge work that burn people out. Your team shouldn't spend time on:
- Reading and summarizing documents
- Extracting data from reports
- Writing routine communications
- Analyzing standard patterns
- Creating derivative content

They should focus on:
- Strategic thinking
- Creative problem solving
- Relationship building
- Innovation
- High-value decisions

## Getting Started with LLM Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Problem Discovery">
    Show us your manual process. We need to intimately understand what you're trying to achieve and why you're doing it this way. Have you explored other options? Can we solve it without LLMs first?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Solution Design">
    Determine where LLMs add value versus deterministic code. Understand scale implications and identify what LLMs excel at (context, judgment) versus their limitations (like consistent tone of voice in mass market models).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Build systems with proper engineering principles - queuing, caching, retry mechanisms - while integrating LLMs for the intelligent parts that would otherwise be impossible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deployment">
    2-week sprints start at $6K, typical projects run $15K over 4-6 weeks. We avoid healthcare, mental health, law, and heavily regulated sectors where hallucinations could cause damage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  WithSeismic builds LLM workflows for challenges that traditional automation can't touch. We combine over a decade of automation experience with cutting-edge LLM capabilities.
