## Stop Planning. Start Shipping.

You have an AI automation idea. Maybe it's been sitting in your backlog for months. Maybe your team keeps talking about it but never starts. Maybe you tried building it but got stuck in complexity.

**We turn that idea into production reality in 4 weeks. For $25,000.**

<Warning>
  This isn't a prototype or proof of concept. You get production-ready code that handles real workloads, deployed and running.
</Warning>

## The 4-Week Sprint Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Week 1: Discovery & Architecture">
    **Monday**: Kickoff call to understand your vision and constraints

    **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Map workflows and identify integration points

    **Thursday**: Present technical architecture for approval

  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 2: Core Development">
    Build the foundation:
    - Set up infrastructure and deployment pipeline
    - Implement core business logic
    - Create data models and storage layer

  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 3: Intelligence Layer">
    Add the AI magic:
    - Integrate LLM capabilities (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
    - Implement prompt engineering and optimization
    - Build error handling and fallback systems
    - Create structured output generation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 4: Polish & Deploy">
    Ship to production:
    - Complete testing and edge case handling
    - Deploy to your environment
    - Conduct handoff training with your team

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if my idea changes during development?">
    We expect some evolution. The weekly check-ins ensure we're building the right thing. Major pivots might require scope adjustment, but minor changes are part of the process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you work with our existing codebase?">
    Yes. We integrate with your current systems, databases, and workflows. The MVP becomes part of your ecosystem, not a standalone island.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about security and compliance?">
    We follow security best practices by default. Specific compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.) may require additional scope, which we'll identify during discovery.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you deliver so fast?">
    Focus, experience, and proven patterns. We've built similar systems many times. We know what works and what doesn't. We don't waste time on things that don't matter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if we need changes after delivery?">
    You get 30 days of support included. After that, we offer maintenance packages or can train your team to take over. The code is 100% yours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you sign NDAs?">
    Yes, we're happy to sign NDAs. We treat all client work as confidential by default. Your competitive advantage stays yours.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
