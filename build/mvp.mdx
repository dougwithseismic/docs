## Stop Planning. Start Shipping.

<Info>
**How long does it take to build an MVP?**
Our 6-week MVP process transforms your idea into a production-ready application. Most clients see working prototypes within 2 weeks and full deployment by week 6.
</Info>

You have an AI automation idea. Maybe it's been sitting in your backlog for months. Maybe your team keeps talking about it but never starts. Maybe you tried building it but got stuck in complexity.

**We turn that idea into production reality. Like Snacker.ai - from Lovable prototype to 5,000+ users and paying customers in 3 months.**

## The 6-Week MVP Process

<Info>
**What exactly do you deliver in 6 weeks?**
A complete AI-powered MVP with core features, deployment infrastructure, authentication, documentation, and 30 days of support - everything needed for real users.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Week 1: Discovery & Architecture">
    **Monday**: Kickoff call to understand your vision and constraints

    **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Map workflows and identify integration points

    **Thursday**: Present technical architecture for approval

    **Friday**: Finalize specifications and success metrics
  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 2: Core Development">
    Build the foundation:
    - Set up infrastructure and deployment pipeline
    - Implement core business logic
    - Create data models and storage layer
    - Build authentication and security
  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 3: Intelligence Layer">
    Add the AI magic:
    - Integrate LLM capabilities (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
    - Implement prompt engineering and optimization
    - Build error handling and fallback systems
    - Create structured output generation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 4-5: Integration & Testing">
    Connect everything:
    - API integrations and webhooks
    - Third-party service connections
    - End-to-end testing scenarios
    - Performance optimization
  </Step>

  <Step title="Week 6: Polish & Deploy">
    Ship to production:
    - Complete testing and edge case handling
    - Deploy to your environment
    - Conduct handoff training with your team
    - Deliver documentation and maintenance guides
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Our Approach Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus on Core Value" icon="target">
    We don't build everything - we build the one thing that matters most. The 20% of features that deliver 80% of value. This laser focus ensures you get maximum impact.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Proven Patterns" icon="layers">
  After 100+ projects, we have templates, libraries, and patterns that
  accelerate development. We're not figuring it out - we're applying what works.
  This means faster delivery and fewer bugs.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Senior Execution" icon="star">
  Doug personally leads every MVP sprint. No junior developers learning on your
  dime. Senior expertise from day one means better architecture decisions and
  cleaner code.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Opinionated Decisions" icon="bolt">
    We make technical decisions quickly based on experience. No analysis paralysis or committee reviews. We know what works and we implement it efficiently.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if my idea changes during development?">
    We expect some evolution. The weekly check-ins ensure we're building the right thing. Major pivots might require scope adjustment, but minor changes are part of the process.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can you work with our existing codebase?">
  Yes. We integrate with your current systems, databases, and workflows. The MVP
  becomes part of your ecosystem, not a standalone island.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What about security and compliance?">
  We follow security best practices by default. Specific compliance requirements
  (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.) may require additional scope, which we'll identify during
  discovery.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do you deliver so fast?">
  Focus, experience, and proven patterns. We've built similar systems many
  times. We know what works and what doesn't. We don't waste time on things that
  don't matter.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What if we need changes after delivery?">
  You get 30 days of support included. After that, we offer maintenance packages
  or can train your team to take over. The code is 100% yours.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you sign NDAs?">
    Yes, we're happy to sign NDAs. We treat all client work as confidential by default. Your competitive advantage stays yours.
  </Accordion>
