## Automate Any Web Workflow That Requires a Human

<Info>
**What web tasks can Playwright automate for my business?**
Playwright automates any browser-based workflow - downloading reports, updating listings, managing campaigns, extracting data - eliminating 2-3 hours of manual clicking per person daily.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **The hidden time sink**: Your team logs into 20+ platforms daily. No APIs. No integrations. Just endless clicking, copying, pasting. This manual browser work costs you 2-3 hours per person, per day.
</Warning>

Your team logs into 20 different platforms daily. Downloading reports. Updating listings. Checking competitors. Managing campaigns. Extracting data. These require clicking through complex UIs, handling dynamic content, and navigating multi-step processes -- no APIs available.

Playwright automation eliminates this manual browser work, turning hours of clicking into seconds of execution.

## What Is Playwright Automation?

<Info>
**How is Playwright different from basic web scrapers?**
Playwright controls real browsers and handles complex authentication, dynamic content, and multi-step processes - it acts like a human user rather than just scraping static HTML.
</Info>

Playwright is Microsoft's browser automation framework that controls real browsers programmatically. Unlike basic web scrapers that break when a site updates, Playwright automation acts as a user on behalf of users:

- **Controls real browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - not just scraping
- **Handles complex workflows**: Multi-step processes across different platforms
- **Manages authentication**: Login flows, 2FA, sessions across affiliate platforms
- **Processes dynamic content**: Wait for AJAX, handle popups, test live functionality
- **API stitching**: Combines browser automation with API calls for complete solutions
- **Runs headless or visible**: Debug visually or run at scale

## The Problems Only Playwright Can Solve

<Info>
**What types of sites require Playwright instead of simple scraping?**
Sites without APIs, complex authentication flows, JavaScript-heavy applications, and multi-step workflows that require human-like interaction and decision-making.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sites Without APIs">
    <Icon icon="globe" />

    <Check>Manage cookie-based sessions</Check>
    <Check>Navigate 2FA challenges</Check>
    <Check>Maintain persistent authentication</Check>
    <Check>Switch between multiple accounts</Check>
