## We're Not Your Typical Company

WithSeismic isn't looking for traditional corporate employees. We're looking for growth engineers—people who think in conversion rates and ship code that generates pipeline. If you can bridge the gap between "that would convert" and "I built it," you belong here.

## Our Hiring Philosophy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ship Over Talk" icon="rocket">
    We value working prototypes over perfect presentations. Show us what you've built, not what you could build.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Growth Mindset" icon="chart-line">
    Every line of code should move a metric. If you can't explain how it drives growth, we question why we're building it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Speed Matters" icon="bolt">
    We operate in 2-4 week sprints because that's when clients need results. Perfection next quarter doesn't help anyone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Communication" icon="comments">
    No corporate speak. No politics. Say what you mean, back it with data, and focus on outcomes.
  </Card>

## The Hiring Process

### 1. Initial Application (15 minutes)
Send us:
- One thing you've built that directly impacted revenue
- The metric it moved and by how much
- A link to see it in action (or a video if it's behind auth)

We don't care about your resume. We care about results.

### 2. Technical Screen (30 minutes)
Quick call with Doug to discuss:
- Your approach to the build
- Technical decisions you made and why
- How you measured success
- What you'd do differently

### 3. Paid Test Project ($500-1,000)
We give you a real client brief (anonymized) and 1 week to build a working prototype. This isn't free work—we pay for your time, and you keep the code.

What we're looking for:
- Can you ship something functional in a week?
- Does it actually solve the growth problem?
- Is the code maintainable?
- Did you instrument tracking from day one?

### 4. Client Simulation (90 minutes)
You present your prototype to Doug and a "client" (team member playing the role). We throw curveballs:
- "Can we add this feature?"
- "What if we need it to scale to 100k users?"
- "How would you measure success?"

This shows us how you think on your feet and communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

### 5. Decision & Offer
We move fast. If you're a fit, you'll have an offer within 48 hours of the final interview.

## What Makes a Great WithSeismic Team Member

**You ship first, optimize later**
Perfect is the enemy of done. You understand that a working calculator today beats a perfect one next month.

**You think in user journeys, not features**
Every interactive tool should guide users toward a conversion moment. You design backwards from the "aha!" moment.

**You measure everything**
If you're not tracking it, it didn't happen. You instrument analytics before you ship, not after.

**You can context switch**
One day you're building a React component, the next you're debugging a Hono API, the day after you're optimizing conversion copy. Variety energizes you.

**You communicate progress, not problems**
When something's blocked, you come with solutions. Daily updates are about what shipped, not what's stuck.

## Remote-First Culture

We're fully distributed with team members across Europe and North America. Here's how we make it work:

- **Async by default**: Documentation over meetings
- **Overlap hours**: 2-4 hours of daily overlap for collaboration
- **Weekly sync**: One 30-minute all-hands on Mondays
- **Quarterly meetups**: In-person team gatherings in Prague (optional but fun)

## Growth Opportunities

WithSeismic is small by design, but that means more opportunity for those who join:

- **Client ownership**: Run your own sprints end-to-end after ramping up
- **Revenue share**: 10% commission on any client work you source
- **Open source contribution**: Build tools the community can use
- **Conference speaking**: Represent WithSeismic at growth and dev events
- **Equity potential**: As we grow, early team members become partners

## Compensation Philosophy

We pay market rates for senior talent, not junior rates for senior work:

- **Engineers**: €60k-€120k depending on experience
- **Growth Specialists**: €40k-€80k + commission
- **Contractors**: €300-€600/day for project work

We believe in transparency—these ranges are real, and we'll tell you exactly where you fall in them and why.

## Who Shouldn't Apply

Let's save everyone time. This isn't for you if:

- You need extensive oversight and hand-holding
- You optimize for perfect code over shipping fast
- You think marketing and revenue are "someone else's problem"
- You want the stability of a big corporation
- You can't handle direct feedback

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes WithSeismic different from other remote development companies?">
    We're growth engineers, not just developers. Every line of code should move a business metric. We operate in 2-4 week sprint cycles because that's when clients need results. We focus on shipping tools that generate pipeline, not perfect code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the paid test project work?">
    We give you a real (anonymized) client brief and one week to build a working prototype. You're paid $500-1,000 for your time regardless of outcome. This lets both sides assess fit without risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'ship first, optimize later' mean in practice?">
    We prioritize working solutions over perfect architecture. A calculator that helps clients today beats a perfect one that ships next month. Once something's working and generating value, then we optimize.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does remote collaboration work across time zones?">
    We're async-first with 2-4 hours of daily overlap for collaboration. Most communication happens through documented progress updates rather than meetings. We have one 30-minute weekly sync on Mondays.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What growth opportunities exist in a small team?">
    Small teams mean bigger impact per person. You can own entire client relationships, earn revenue share on business you source, contribute to open source projects, and speak at conferences representing WithSeismic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you measure success for team members?">
    We track client results, not hours worked. Success is measured by tools shipped, problems solved, and business value delivered. We care about the metric your code moves, not lines written.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't have experience with growth marketing?">
    We can teach marketing fundamentals to strong developers. What we can't teach is the ability to ship fast and think in user journeys. If you're curious about how code drives business results, we'll help you learn.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the career progression at WithSeismic?">
    Early team members become partners as we grow. You can progress from executing projects to owning client relationships to leading your own specialty area. Equity potential increases with tenure and impact.
