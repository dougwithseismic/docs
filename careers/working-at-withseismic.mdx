## What We Look For

We need people who can ship tools that actually convert. If you've built something that moved revenue, you'll fit in. If you're still talking about what you could build someday, probably not.

Every project here runs on a 2-4 week sprint. Clients don't have months to wait. Neither do we.

## The Hiring Process

### 1. Initial Application (15 minutes)
Send us:
- One thing you've built that directly impacted revenue
- The metric it moved and by how much
- A link to see it in action (or a video if it's behind auth)

We don't care about your resume. We care about results.

### 2. Technical Screen (30 minutes)
Quick call with Doug to discuss:
- Your approach to the build
- Technical decisions you made and why
- How you measured success
- What you'd do differently

### 3. Paid Test Project ($500-1,000)
We give you a real client brief (anonymized) and 1 week to build a working prototype. This isn't free work—we pay for your time, and you keep the code.

What we're looking for:
- Can you ship something functional in a week?
- Does it actually solve the growth problem?
- Is the code maintainable?
- Did you instrument tracking from day one?

### 4. Client Simulation (90 minutes)
You present your prototype to Doug and a "client" (team member playing the role). We throw curveballs:
- "Can we add this feature?"
- "What if we need it to scale to 100k users?"
- "How would you measure success?"

This shows us how you think on your feet and communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

### 5. Decision & Offer
We move fast. If you're a fit, you'll have an offer within 48 hours of the final interview.

## Who Does Well Here

Ship first, optimize later. A working calculator today beats a perfect one next month.

Track everything. If you're not measuring it, it didn't happen.

Switch contexts fast. Monday you're building React components, Tuesday you're debugging APIs, Wednesday you're fixing conversion copy.

## Remote-First Culture

We're fully distributed with team members across Europe and North America. Here's how we make it work:

- **Async by default**: Documentation over meetings
- **Overlap hours**: 2-4 hours of daily overlap for collaboration
- **Weekly sync**: One 30-minute all-hands on Mondays
- **Quarterly meetups**: In-person team gatherings in Prague (optional but fun)

## What You Get

- Run your own client sprints after you ramp up
- 10% commission on any work you bring in
- Equity for early team members
- Conference speaking if that's your thing

## Pay

- **Engineers**: €60k-€120k
- **Growth Specialists**: €40k-€80k + commission
- **Contractors**: €300-€600/day

## This Won't Work If

You need hand-holding, want perfect code over shipping fast, think revenue is someone else's problem, or can't handle direct feedback.

  <Accordion title="How does the paid test project work?">
    We give you a real client brief (anonymized) and one week to build a prototype. You get paid $500-1,000 regardless of outcome.

  <Accordion title="How does remote work across time zones?">
    Async-first with 2-4 hours of daily overlap. One 30-minute sync on Mondays. Most communication is documented updates, not meetings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't know growth marketing?">
    We can teach marketing to strong developers. We can't teach shipping fast. If you're curious about how code drives revenue, we'll help you learn.
