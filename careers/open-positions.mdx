## Outbound Growth Specialist ‚Äî Prague or Remote (CET)

We're building an efficient, repeatable outbound engine that books high-quality meetings with ideal customers - B2B challenger brands looking for scale by sending engineers to do a Marketer's job.

We help clients by building tools, interactive demos, and irresistible lead magnets to stand out in a sea of boring ‚Äî and it's on a commission with no upfront cost!

You'll own the top of funnel: list building, personalisation at scale, multi-channel sequencing, reply triage, and learning loops. You'll start with documented SOPs and improve them through testing and data.

### üöÄ Why this role matters

We don't have an outbound function yet. You'll set it up from zero: define ICPs, build the system, and create a repeatable engine that delivers measurable results across email and LinkedIn.

### üß≠ Zero-to-one mandate

- You'll be the first dedicated outbound/growth hire. This is a build-from-scratch role.
- Turn our great work into pipeline: define ICPs, stand up systems, and get us in front of the right people fast.
- Work directly with the founder to iterate messaging, targets, and process week-over-week.
- Measure everything. Ship fast, learn faster, and document what sticks so others can scale it later.

### üßë‚Äçüíª What you'll own

- Build and enrich ICP-aligned prospect lists from defined sources
- Write and iterate first-line personalization and body copy at scale
- Run multi-step sequences across Email and LinkedIn end-to-end
- Triage replies, handle follow-ups, and book meetings
- Maintain list hygiene and monitor deliverability and domain health
- Weekly reporting on opens, replies, positives, meetings, and learnings
- Run structured A/B tests on copy, targeting, timing, and channels
- Document and evolve SOPs as you discover what works

### üîé Must-have skills

- Hands-on B2B outbound experience running campaigns end-to-end
- Sequencing across Email and LinkedIn, including reply handling
- Prospecting and enrichment with clear ICP criteria
- Strong copy skills with an experimentation mindset
- CRM hygiene and basic analytics competency
- Comfort operating in documented SOPs and improving them

### ü•≥ Nice-to-haves

- Email deliverability best practices and warm-up workflows
- Light scripting or automation for enrichment workflows
- Familiarity with Sales Nav, Apollo, Instantly, HubSpot or similar
- Experience in early-stage or lean growth teams

### üèÜ What success looks like

- **Month 1**: Audit live sequences and lists, ship first quick wins
- **Month 2**: Repeatable micro-list + messaging playbook shipped
- **Day 90**: 2‚Äì3x growth in qualified meetings from outbound
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Email reply 3‚Äì8% with 1‚Äì3% positive
  - LinkedIn reply 10‚Äì20% with 5‚Äì10% positive
  - 70%+ show rate

### Location and Engagement

- Flexible, remote-friendly
- Contractor or full-time considered

### Compensation

- **Contractor**: $3k‚Äì$6k per month depending on scope and experience
- **Full-time**: $55k‚Äì$85k base + variable

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes WithSeismic different from other agencies or dev shops?">
    We're focused specifically on building interactive tools that convert - not just websites or campaigns. Our specialty is creating engaging experiences like calculators, assessments, and demos that prospects can't ignore. We're growth engineers who happen to do client work, not traditional developers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this role fully remote or do you prefer certain locations?">
    We're remote-first but timezone alignment matters for collaboration. The current opening lists Prague or Remote (CET) because we value overlap with European business hours. However, we're open to exceptional candidates in other timezones who can demonstrate strong async communication skills.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does the career growth path look like at WithSeismic?">
    As a small, growing team, growth opportunities are significant but depend on impact and initiative. Successful team members often expand their scope rapidly - from individual contributors to owning entire growth channels or client relationships. We promote based on results and value-added contributions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you measure success for the Outbound Growth Specialist role?">
    Clear, measurable metrics: email reply rates of 3-8% with 1-3% positive responses, LinkedIn reply rates of 10-20% with 5-10% positive, and 70%+ meeting show rates. By day 90, we expect 2-3x growth in qualified meetings from outbound efforts. We focus on leading indicators that drive revenue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What tools and technology does WithSeismic use?">
    Our stack varies by project needs but typically includes modern web technologies (React, TypeScript), automation tools (n8n, Zapier), and growth tools (HubSpot, Apollo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator). For the outbound role specifically, you'll work with email sequencing, LinkedIn automation, and CRM systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the company culture like?">
    We value shipping over perfection, learning fast from data, and direct communication. Small team means everyone's voice matters and decisions happen quickly. We're results-oriented but understand that breakthrough growth comes from creative experimentation, not just following playbooks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does compensation work - contractor vs full-time?">
    We're flexible on engagement structure. Contractor rates range from $3k-$6k monthly depending on scope and experience. Full-time roles start at $55k-$85k base plus variable compensation tied to results. We're open to discussing what works best for exceptional candidates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What kind of clients does WithSeismic work with?">
    We focus on B2B challenger brands looking to scale through better tools and experiences rather than just more ad spend. Typical clients are growth-stage companies who want to stand out with interactive demos, lead magnets, and conversion tools that their competitors can't easily copy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is prior agency or client services experience required?">
    Not necessarily. We value results over background. If you've successfully grown metrics and can work directly with clients professionally, that's more important than where you gained that experience. However, comfort with client communication and project management is essential.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I'm interested but don't perfectly match the current openings?">
    Reach out anyway. We're always looking for exceptional growth engineers who can build things that convert. If you have a compelling vision for how to grow WithSeismic or serve our clients better, we want to hear from you. The best hires often come from unexpected conversations.
