## Outbound Growth Specialist ‚Äî Prague or Remote (CET)

We're building an efficient, repeatable outbound engine that books high-quality meetings with ideal customers - B2B challenger brands looking for scale by sending engineers to do a Marketer's job.

We help clients by building tools, interactive demos, and irresistible lead magnets to stand out in a sea of boring ‚Äî and it's on a commission with no upfront cost!

You'll own the top of funnel: list building, personalisation at scale, multi-channel sequencing, reply triage, and learning loops. You'll start with documented SOPs and improve them through testing and data.

### üöÄ Why this role matters

We don't have an outbound function yet. You'll set it up from zero: define ICPs, build the system, and create a repeatable engine that delivers measurable results across email and LinkedIn.

### üß≠ Zero-to-one mandate

- You'll be the first dedicated outbound/growth hire. This is a build-from-scratch role.
- Turn our great work into pipeline: define ICPs, stand up systems, and get us in front of the right people fast.
- Work directly with the founder to iterate messaging, targets, and process week-over-week.
- Measure everything. Ship fast, learn faster, and document what sticks so others can scale it later.

### üßë‚Äçüíª What you'll own

- Build and enrich ICP-aligned prospect lists from defined sources
- Write and iterate first-line personalization and body copy at scale
- Run multi-step sequences across Email and LinkedIn end-to-end
- Triage replies, handle follow-ups, and book meetings
- Maintain list hygiene and monitor deliverability and domain health
- Weekly reporting on opens, replies, positives, meetings, and learnings
- Run structured A/B tests on copy, targeting, timing, and channels
- Document and evolve SOPs as you discover what works

### üîé Must-have skills

- Hands-on B2B outbound experience running campaigns end-to-end
- Sequencing across Email and LinkedIn, including reply handling
- Prospecting and enrichment with clear ICP criteria
- Strong copy skills with an experimentation mindset
- CRM hygiene and basic analytics competency
- Comfort operating in documented SOPs and improving them

### ü•≥ Nice-to-haves

- Email deliverability best practices and warm-up workflows
- Light scripting or automation for enrichment workflows
- Familiarity with Sales Nav, Apollo, Instantly, HubSpot or similar
- Experience in early-stage or lean growth teams

### üèÜ What success looks like

- **Month 1**: Audit live sequences and lists, ship first quick wins
- **Month 2**: Repeatable micro-list + messaging playbook shipped
- **Day 90**: 2‚Äì3x growth in qualified meetings from outbound
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Email reply 3‚Äì8% with 1‚Äì3% positive
  - LinkedIn reply 10‚Äì20% with 5‚Äì10% positive
  - 70%+ show rate

### Location and Engagement

- Flexible, remote-friendly
- Contractor or full-time considered

### Compensation

- **Contractor**: $3k‚Äì$6k per month depending on scope and experience
- **Full-time**: $55k‚Äì$85k base + variable
