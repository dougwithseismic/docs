## Why This Stack?

<Info>
  **What makes this tech stack special for automation tools?** Every technology
  is chosen for speed, type safety, and performance - enabling us to deliver
  production-ready tools in 2-4 week sprints with minimal bugs.
</Info>

Every tool in our stack is chosen for a specific reason:

- **Speed**: Vite's instant HMR and Next.js optimizations mean we iterate faster
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors before runtime, reducing bugs in production
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling means we spend time building features, not fighting config
- **Performance**: Every choice prioritizes sub-second load times and smooth interactions
- **Scalability**: From MVP to millions of users, this stack grows with your success

<Info>
  This is the exact stack we use to build interactive tools that convert. No
  theoretical choicesâ€”these are battle-tested technologies we ship with every
  day.
