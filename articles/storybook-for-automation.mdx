# How I Structure the AI Function at Challenger Brands Serious About Using LLMs to Get Ahead

*By Doug Silkstone | March 10, 2025*

> After 15 years building automation systems, I've developed some opinions about what actually works. This is the blueprint I've been using with teams who want to move fast without getting caught up in hype. Take what's useful, adapt it to your needs, and let me know how it goes.

Here's what I'm seeing: Teams have ChatGPT licenses, Zapier subscriptions, multiple no-code platforms, but they're struggling to get real value. The automations they build get lost, forgotten, or can't be reused by other teams.

What's been working for me is thinking about architecture first, tools second. Imagine having a structured approach where every automation becomes discoverable and reusable—like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for AI automation. A living catalog where your team's work compounds instead of getting buried.

Here's the approach I've been using—feel free to adapt it to your situation.

## Start Here: Code Blocks as Your Foundation (Not Another Platform)

<Note>
  **Key principle**: Start with simple, atomic code blocks that solve real problems. One input, one output, one clear purpose. You can always add complexity later.
</Note>

These blocks handle everything from basic tasks to complex operations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Basic Operations" icon="envelope">
    - Send emails
    - Create tickets
    - Post to Slack
    - Update spreadsheets
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complex Processing" icon="chart-line">
    - Pull Shopify analytics
    - Process Stripe invoices
    - Execute SQL queries
    - Run ML models
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The key is **standardization**—every block follows the same pattern:

```typescript
interface CodeBlock {
  input: ZodSchema
  handler: async (input) => output
  output: ZodSchema
  metadata: {
    name: string
    description: string
    category: string
    version: string
  }
}
```

<Accordion title="Platform Flexibility: The Game Changer">
  Bundle blocks into components when it makes sense, creating a Lego-style ecosystem. The beauty? **Platform agnostic**:

  - A workflow built in n8n becomes a reusable component in code
  - A Python script becomes a no-code module
  - A Zapier automation becomes an API endpoint
  - A Make.com scenario becomes a TypeScript function

  This flexibility is essential for challenger brands—you need to meet your team where they are, not force them into yet another tool they'll abandon in three months.
</Accordion>

Every component lives in a central registry that automatically generates production-ready infrastructure. This ensures both developers and no-code users have equal access to your organization's automation capabilities.

## Why Most AI Implementations Struggle

<Warning>
  According to [Red Hat's research](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/automated-enterprise-e-book), 77% of IT professionals consider automation essential, yet most implementations fail. The problem? Focusing on tools rather than architecture.
</Warning>

The statistics tell a stark story:

| Success Metric | Winners | Losers | Gap |
|----------------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Process Automation** | 20M records/year | &lt;100K records/year | 200x |
| **Time Savings** | 100,000+ hours | &lt;1,000 hours | 100x |
| **ROI** | 300-500% | Negative | ∞ |
| **Adoption Rate** | >80% of employees | &lt;10% of employees | 8x |

### The Platform Comparison Reality

    **Limitation**: Expensive at scale, limited customization
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

What I've found is that teams need a structured methodology that works across their existing platforms. A practical way to create, document, test, and share automation components that any motivated team member can understand and use.

## Building Your Component Registry: A Practical Approach

What's worked well for me is starting with a straightforward component registry that serves as the central hub for all automation efforts. I've implemented this approach at several companies, and it's been consistently effective.

This registry isn't just documentation—it's an active system that:

- Makes every automation component discoverable across teams
- Provides crystal-clear usage instructions and examples
- Enables interactive testing before integration
- Automatically generates integration points for any platform

Think of it as building a workshop for AI components, where teams can develop and test automation in isolation before deploying at scale. The goal is to create repeatable systems that compound value over time instead of starting from scratch with each new project.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<Info>
  After working with dozens of teams on AI implementations, I've noticed four patterns that consistently cause problems. Here's what to watch out for:
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🏝️ The Silo Trap" icon="island-tropical">
    **Problem**: Teams build in isolation. Engineering teams often boost productivity significantly with AI tools but struggle to share gains company-wide.

    **Impact**: Majority of automation value often trapped in individual teams

    **Solution**: Mandate every automation becomes a reusable component from inception. No exceptions.

    ```yaml
    policy:
      all_automations:
        must_register: true
        must_document: true
        must_test: true
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="♻️ The Duplication Death Spiral" icon="recycle">
    **Problem**: Same solutions built repeatedly. Large organizations often build the same integrations multiple times.

    **Impact**: Significant wasted development effort

    **Solution**: Registry with mandatory search before new development.

    ```typescript
    // Before creating any component:
    const existing = await registry.search({
      functionality: 'slack notification',
      department: 'any'
    })
    if (existing.length > 0) {
      useExisting(existing[0])
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🔌 The Integration Nightmare" icon="plug">
    **Problem**: Manual integration creates bottlenecks. [Red Hat's automation study](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/it-automation-book) found 60% of barriers are cultural, not technical.

    **Impact**: 3-6 month delays for cross-team adoption

    **Solution**: Auto-generate integration points for every platform.

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Auto-Generated" icon="sparkles">
        - REST APIs
        - GraphQL endpoints
        - Webhook receivers
        - Event streams
      </Card>
      <Card title="Platform Nodes" icon="puzzle-piece">
        - n8n nodes
        - Zapier apps
        - Make modules
        - Custom SDKs
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="📚 The Knowledge Black Hole" icon="book-skull">
    **Problem**: Undocumented automations die in darkness.

    **Impact**: 90% of components never reused

    **Solution**: Documentation-as-code with enforcement.

    ```typescript
    @Component({
      name: 'Invoice Processor',
      description: 'Processes Stripe invoices and updates CRM',
      examples: [
        { input: sampleInvoice, output: expectedResult }
      ],
      sla: '99.9% uptime, &lt;500ms response'
    })
    class InvoiceProcessor {
      // Won't compile without decorator metadata
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Four Pillars for Success

Here's the framework that's been working well for the teams I've worked with:

### 1. Democratized Creation with Structure
Everyone can contribute automations, but within a clear framework. This approach can help teams significantly increase output without adding engineers. The key is making component creation accessible to non-technical team members while maintaining production standards.

### 2. Modular Architecture
Instead of monolithic platforms, focus on building composable blocks that your team will actually use:

- **Self-Describing**: Components explain themselves through schemas
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Works in code, no-code, or hybrid environments
- **Instantly Testable**: Validate behavior before integration
- **Auto-Documented**: Documentation generated from code, not maintained separately

### 3. The Registry as a Value Center
The component registry becomes more than infrastructure—it's an asset that drives value. A well-implemented registry can process significant transaction volumes with minimal maintenance:

- **Discovery Engine**: AI-powered search finds components by describing what you need
- **Automatic API Generation**: Every component becomes an endpoint instantly
- **Version Control Built-In**: Track changes, dependencies, and compatibility automatically
- **Security by Design**: Role-based access control at the component level
- **Performance Monitoring**: Know which components deliver value, which need optimization

Core registry requirements:
- TypeScript/Zod schemas for type safety
- GraphQL interface for flexible querying
- Git-based versioning for complete history
- Automated testing on every change
- SLA tracking for mission-critical components

### 4. Production-Ready From the Start
Rather than building proof of concepts that get stuck, aim to ship production-ready components from day one:

- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) for interactive exploration
- Automatic cloud exposure via [secure tunneling](https://ngrok.com/our-product/secure-tunnels)
- Load balancing and queue management built-in
- Monitoring and alerting out of the box

## The Real Impact (With Actual Numbers)

### For Individual Contributors
- Stop reinventing wheels—discover what exists instantly
- Ship features 10x faster using pre-built components
- Focus on business logic, not boilerplate
- Contribute improvements that benefit everyone

As documented in [Microsoft's real-world automation stories](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/blog/power-automate/real-world-automation-stories-with-microsoft-power-automate/), teams that adopt component-based approaches see dramatic productivity gains.

### For Engineering Teams
- Establish and enforce standards automatically
- Eliminate duplicate work across departments
- Ship with confidence—everything is pre-tested
- Scale teams without scaling headcount

### For Leadership
- Direct line-of-sight from automation to business impact
- Quantifiable ROI on every automation investment
- Compressed time-to-market for new capabilities
- Transform fixed costs into variable wins

## The Technical Stack I Recommend

Here's what's been working well for me and the teams I work with:

### Type Safety: The Foundation

When you're building LEGO blocks, you need to know their shape, size, color, and how they fit together. That's where **TypeScript + Zod** comes in.

Zod gives you blazing-fast runtime validation (100K+ objects/second) and auto-generates TypeScript types from your schemas. It's perfect for defining component interfaces—making your automation blocks snap together perfectly every time.

### API Layer: Hono

For the API layer, I use [Hono](https://hono.dev/). It's a small, fast web framework that runs anywhere—Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, Node.js. The TypeScript-first design means you get type safety from edge to edge, and at 12KB, it's incredibly lightweight. The developer experience is fantastic, and it just works.

### Documentation That Actually Gets Read

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### The Key Principle

Once you have your compendium of components and you're ready for existing challenges, adding new LEGO blocks becomes trivial. As new tech emerges, you can integrate it as just another block in your system—no need to rebuild everything.

### Implementation Timeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Write Component] -->|5 min| B[Generate APIs]
    B -->|1 min| C[Publish Docs]
    C -->|2 min| D[Create Adapters]
    D -->|1 min| E[Deploy Everywhere]
```

<Info>
  **Timeline**: With this setup, components typically go from code to production in under 10 minutes.
</Info>

## Essential Terminology for AI Functions

- **Code Block**: Atomic unit of automation—single input, single output, single purpose
- **Component**: Orchestrated collection of blocks solving a business problem
- **Registry**: Living catalog of all organizational automation assets
- **Schema**: Contract defining how components communicate
- **Adapter**: Bridge between your components and external platforms
- **Pipeline**: Chain of components processing data sequentially

## KPIs That Actually Matter

<Warning>
  Most companies track vanity metrics. Here are the KPIs that predict real success:
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🔄 Reuse Ratio" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Target**: >70%

    Components used by 2+ teams

    **Why it matters**: Indicates true platform value

### The Value Multiplication Formula

```typescript
const componentValue = {
  developmentCost: 10_000,      // One-time
  timeSavedPerUse: 2,           // Hours
  hourlyRate: 150,              // Dollars
  usesPerMonth: 50,             // Across org

  monthlyROI: function() {
    return (this.timeSavedPerUse * this.hourlyRate * this.usesPerMonth)
           - (this.developmentCost / 12)
  },

  annualMultiplier: function() {
    return (this.monthlyROI() * 12) / this.developmentCost
  }
}

// Result: 17x annual return on investment
```

<Note>
  **Expected Impact**: A well-designed payment processing component can save significant costs with minimal development time
</Note>

## Bridging Strategy and Execution

One of the biggest challenges is aligning what leadership envisions with what's technically feasible. Here's how this architecture helps bridge that gap:

| Level | Traditional Problem | This Architecture's Solution |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **C-Suite** | "We're doing AI" with no measurable impact | Direct metrics linking automation to revenue/cost |
| **Management** | Can't standardize or scale initiatives | Central registry enforces standards automatically |
| **Contributors** | Building in isolation, zero visibility | Every creation immediately available company-wide |

What I find encouraging is when unexpected collaborations emerge. Junior developers can build components that power executive dashboards, potentially replacing expensive SaaS solutions. That's the kind of democratization that makes this approach worthwhile.

## Moving Forward: Why Timing Matters

<Note>
  The gap between companies effectively using AI and those still experimenting is widening. The good news is that with the right architecture, you can catch up quickly.
</Note>

After implementing AI systems across dozens of organizations, the pattern is clear:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🏆 Winners (20%)">
    - Treat AI as strategic platform
    - Component-first architecture
    - 10-50x productivity gains
    - Compound value creation

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="😐 Strugglers (60%)">
    - Tool-focused approach
    - Scattered initiatives
    - 1-2x productivity gains
    - Linear value creation

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="💀 Losers (20%)">
    - No coherent AI strategy
    - Random experiments
    - Negative ROI
    - Value destruction
    - Disruption victims
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
