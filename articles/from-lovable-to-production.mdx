_Published: March 26, 2025_

Lovable serves as a fantastic tool for quickly prototyping applications; however, most teams consider it as a temporary solution - build in Lovable first, then completely hand it off to developers to rebuild with traditional coding. But what if you want the collaborative fun to continue?

This guide demonstrates how you can have the best of both worlds by building a Turborepo monorepo architecture around your Lovable application using Git submodules. This powerful approach means:

- Non-technical team members can continue rapidly prototyping and iterating in the Lovable environment they're comfortable with
- Developers can simultaneously build robust production infrastructure around the Lovable app
- Changes sync seamlessly between environments without requiring a complete rebuild
- Your team maintains a collaborative workflow instead of a one-time handoff

The result is a sustainable development process where everyone on your team can contribute effectively using the tools they're most productive with.

## Why This Article Exists

<Warning>
**Full transparency: This approach is technically possible but rarely advisable**
We're sharing this knowledge because democratizing information matters. If you're hellbent on the vibe coding route with Lovable, you deserve all the information to make an informed decision. Just understand what you're signing up for.
</Warning>

After 10-15 years pivoting from performance marketing through technical marketing into full-stack engineering, I've taken so much knowledge from the community. This is about giving back - even if it means showing you a path I wouldn't personally recommend.

Some teams will push boundaries and make it work. Maybe for your specific use case, this is perfect. The point is you should have the knowledge to try it and see for yourself if it's going to work or not. There's no bad decision if it's an informed one.

## Understanding the Workflow

<Info>
**How does the Lovable + Turborepo workflow maintain collaboration after handoff?**
The workflow uses Git submodules so non-technical team members can continue prototyping in Lovable while developers build production infrastructure around it, avoiding a one-time handoff model.
</Info>

### Real-World Example: Snacker

The Snacker.ai story perfectly illustrates why the Lovable-to-production path is more painful than people realize. The prototype looked solid on the surface - it had an in-browser video recorder, a substantial Supabase schema, and seemingly worked well. But underneath was a different story.

The codebase was a spaghetti mix of localStorage hacks mixed with security-lacking Supabase functionality. Components followed different patterns - you could see where different AI prompts had generated different architectural approaches. There was no consistent state management, no unified patterns, nothing sustainable.

The founder, Shelby, was completely unaware of these issues. Why would he be? Lovable never shows you the code quality, and even if it did, non-engineers wouldn't recognize the problems. As long as it works in Lovable, that's all that matters, right?

When I recommended a rebuild that would take two weeks to establish solid foundations, Shelby was stubborn: "I don't want to do the rebuild. I want to keep pushing for features." So we deferred it. The result? Every feature took three times longer to build because we had to navigate through the spaghetti.

The breaking point came when Shelby said, "We need Snacker for Teams now." The idea of adding workspaces to that convoluted codebase became a massive bottleneck. What should have been straightforward - architecting patterns for teams versus solo accounts, implementing proper payment flows - became a nightmare of bolting features onto a broken foundation.

Before diving into the technical steps, let's understand the overall workflow:

1. **Lovable + GitHub branches for prototyping**:
   - Your team continues to use Lovable for rapid prototyping
   - Changes are made on feature branches, not directly on main
   - Pull requests are created to review changes before merging to main

2. **Turborepo + Submodule for development**:
   - Your Lovable app exists as a Git submodule inside the Turborepo
   - Developers can build around the app (backend, services, packages)
   - The main app lives in the original repo, everything else is built around it

3. **Synchronized development**:
   - Changes to Lovable can still be made through the Lovable interface
   - Technical changes can be made by developers using Cursor or any code editor
   - Both workflows coexist without disrupting each other

This approach gives you the freedom to continue rapid prototyping while simultaneously building production-ready infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

<Info>
**What do I need before starting a Lovable to production transition?**
You'll need a Lovable app ready for handoff, basic Git/GitHub knowledge, familiarity with monorepo concepts, Cursor IDE, and Node.js with pnpm installed.
</Info>

- A Lovable app ready for handoff
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub
- Familiarity with monorepo concepts
- Cursor IDE installed (recommended)
- Node.js and pnpm

## The Setup Process

<Info>
**What's the overall setup process for transitioning from Lovable to production?**
The process involves connecting Lovable to GitHub, creating a Turborepo monorepo, adding the Lovable app as a Git submodule, building a production backend, and configuring the entire system to work together.
</Info>

### Step 1: GitHub Integration

First, connect your Lovable app to GitHub:

1. In Lovable, go to your project settings
2. Click "Connect to GitHub"
3. Authorize the GitHub integration
4. Create or link to an existing repository

This creates a bidirectional sync between Lovable and GitHub, allowing changes to flow both ways.

### Step 2: Create Your Turborepo

Create a new repository for your production monorepo:

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest my-production-app
cd my-production-app
```

This gives you a starting point with proper TypeScript configuration, build tools, and workspace structure.

### Step 3: Add Lovable App as Submodule

Add your Lovable app repository as a Git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/your-lovable-app.git apps/frontend
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Your directory structure now looks like:

```
my-production-app/
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/          # Your Lovable app (submodule)
│   └── docs/             # Documentation app
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/               # Shared UI components
│   └── config/           # Shared config
└── turbo.json
```

### Step 4: Build Production Backend

The beauty of this approach is that your backend can be anything - Node.js, Go, Rust, or whatever fits your team's expertise. For JavaScript/TypeScript teams, we highly recommend Hono for its exceptional developer experience.

The beauty of this approach is that your backend can be anything - Node.js with Hono/Express, Go, Rust, or whatever fits your team's expertise. Choose a framework that prioritizes:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors during development, not runtime
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Less code to maintain
- **Good Documentation**: Critical for teams with varying experience levels
- **Performance**: Built for production scale

Create a simple backend service that your Lovable app can connect to. The specific technology matters less than having proper architecture from the start.

### Step 5: Connect Frontend to Backend

Configure your Lovable app to communicate with the backend through environment variables and API endpoints. This creates the bridge between your prototype and production infrastructure.

### Step 6: Configure Monorepo Scripts

Set up your build and development scripts to orchestrate all services together. The monorepo structure ensures everything runs in harmony during development and builds correctly for production.

## Advanced Integration Techniques

<Info>
**How can you share components across a Lovable + Turborepo setup?**
Create shared UI packages that both your Lovable app and other monorepo apps can use, ensuring consistency and reusability across your entire development ecosystem.
</Info>

### Shared Components

Create shared UI components and utilities that both your Lovable app and other services can use. This ensures consistency across your entire application ecosystem.

### Database Integration

Implement a proper database layer with migrations, schema management, and type-safe queries. This is where the real complexity lives - something Lovable apps typically handle with basic Supabase calls.


## Benefits of This Approach

<Info>
**What are the main advantages of this Turborepo + Lovable approach?**
This approach enables continuous collaboration, gradual migration from Lovable to custom code, shared codebase management, proper version control, and easy scalability as your project grows.
</Info>

1. **Continuous Collaboration**: Non-technical team members can continue using Lovable while developers build production infrastructure
2. **Gradual Migration**: You can gradually move pieces from Lovable to custom code as needed
3. **Shared Codebase**: All production code lives in one place, making it easier to manage
4. **Version Control**: Everything is properly tracked in Git with clear history
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new services, packages, and apps as your project grows

## The Reality Check: Common Pitfalls

<Warning>
**This approach is a workaround, not a solution**
Before diving into maintenance, let's be honest about what you're signing up for. This workflow shows you *can* combine Lovable with production development, but whether you *should* is a different question.
</Warning>

### The Hard Truth About Lovable to Production

There's a lot of marketing hype out there. Every new AI tool promises that "coding is over," "everyone is a developer now," "you don't need expensive engineers anymore." It sounds too good to be true because it is too good to be true.

If you get caught up in these cycles, you're quickly going to find yourself frustrated. You're paying for a subpar product essentially. People burn through their Lovable credits, get so far, then hit a plateau - maybe a caching issue, a rendering problem, something they don't even have the concepts to understand. That's it. Game over. Make or break for tons of projects.

The true cost? You will hit a brick wall and not be able to go any further. If you're lucky or your scope is super narrow, if you're not building anything ambitious or of real value, you might complete a project before hitting that wall. But for anything a customer would actually pay for? Why take that risk?

The biggest mistake teams make is thinking they can seamlessly slot Lovable into a professional development workflow. Here's what really happens:

**The Technical Debt Avalanche**
- Lovable generates code by piling features on shaky foundations
- Every new request adds another layer of conditional logic
- No consistent patterns between components
- The codebase becomes unmaintainable faster than you realize

**The Knowledge Gap Crisis**
"Engineering is difficult. It's hard." The brutal reality is that someone using Lovable typically lacks the engineering background to understand what they're getting into. They're sold on the promise of building by chatting, but hit a harsh reality check when they encounter real complexity.

Take Snacker's video editor. You want to record a video? Great. Store it? Sure. But then reality hits:
- You need to process 10-20 minute videos
- You need proxy versions for smaller file sizes
- You can't send 500MB to Deepgram or Whisper
- You need transcoding, caching, CDN delivery

As developers, we see these requirements coming from miles away. It's our profession to know these pitfalls and navigate around them. But Lovable makes it easy to feel in control and powerful until you hit these walls. Then you realize: Lovable doesn't know how to do this. ChatGPT doesn't know how to do this. And you don't have the concepts to even know what to ask for.

**The Real Financial Impact**
A founder thinks they're saving $150-200/hour on developer costs. Here's what actually happens:
- You put 90 hours of your time into a product (and your time is valuable too)
- You get completely blocked by technical limitations
- You have to pay a developer anyway, who says one of three things:
  1. "I won't work on this mess"
  2. "I'll rebuild it from scratch first"
  3. "I'll work on it but charge 3x my normal rate"
- Every feature takes 3x longer due to technical debt
- The cost in lost velocity becomes untenable

### When This Approach Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't)

**Good For:**
- Disposable prototypes that won't see production
- MVPs with a clear rebuild plan
- Teams with strong engineering leadership who understand the trade-offs
- Projects where speed to market outweighs technical debt

**Not Good For:**
- Mission-critical applications
- Systems that need to scale reliably
- Teams without experienced engineers to manage the complexity
- Long-term products without a refactoring budget

### The Spaghetti Corner

From the Snacker case study: "The Lovable prototype was in rough shape. People don't realize that AI-generated code tends to pile features on shaky foundations."

What you'll encounter:
- If-else logic piled upon if-else logic
- No architectural planning or design patterns
- API keys exposed in frontend code
- Missing error handling and edge cases
- Performance bottlenecks invisible to non-engineers

### Managing the Pain Points

If you still choose this path, here's what you're signing up to manage:

**Submodule Syncing Hell**
- Conflicts between Lovable changes and manual edits
- Git submodule update failures
- Diverging branches that become impossible to merge
- Lost work when syncing goes wrong

**Environment Variable Chaos**
- Different configs for Lovable, local dev, and production
- Secrets accidentally committed to repositories
- Mismatched variables causing silent failures

**The Ten Chess Games Problem**
You'll be simultaneously managing:
- Lovable's auto-generated patterns
- Your production architecture standards
- Framework best practices
- Security requirements
- Performance optimization
- Database schema evolution
- API versioning
- Testing strategies
- Deployment pipelines
- User data protection

### The Deployment Disaster

Deployment is where the Lovable-to-production fantasy completely falls apart. What works locally becomes a nightmare in production:

**Environment Variable Explosion**
- Lovable apps aren't built for multiple environments
- Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Missing build-time vs runtime variable distinction
- Secrets exposed in client-side bundles

**The Build Process Breaking Point**
- Lovable's build assumptions don't match production needs
- Memory limits exceeded during builds
- Missing dependencies only discovered at deploy time
- Build caching incompatible with monorepo structure

**Runtime Surprises**
- CORS issues that didn't exist locally
- Database connection pooling problems
- Rate limiting on third-party APIs
- Memory leaks from unoptimized code
- Cold start times that kill user experience

**The Monitoring Blind Spot**
- No error tracking built in
- No performance monitoring
- No way to debug production issues
- Logs scattered across services
- No alerting when things break

The harsh reality: These hybrid apps often work fine on localhost:3000 but crumble under real-world conditions. You'll spend more time debugging deployment issues than you saved using Lovable in the first place.

## Maintaining the Workflow

<Info>
**How do you keep Lovable changes and code changes in sync?**
Lovable automatically pushes to GitHub, then you pull changes to your submodule. For technical changes, you make them directly in code and they sync back to Lovable automatically.
</Info>

### For Lovable Changes

1. Make changes in Lovable interface
2. Lovable automatically pushes to GitHub
3. Pull the latest changes to your submodule:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add apps/frontend
git commit -m "Update frontend from Lovable"
```

### For Technical Changes

1. Make changes directly in the code using Cursor or your preferred editor
2. Test locally with the full monorepo setup
3. Push changes to the Lovable repository
4. Changes automatically sync back to Lovable

## The Better Path: An Honest Recommendation

<Warning>
**The hard truth about Lovable in production**
After taking multiple Lovable apps to paying customers, here's the reality: this submodule approach is a workaround, not a solution. There's a better path.
</Warning>

### When to Use Lovable (And When to Stop)

Think of Lovable-generated code as "dissolvable code" - it has a finite lifespan and that's okay. Lovable is fantastic for:
- Getting ideas out quickly
- Creating disposable prototypes that disappear after the session
- Testing concepts with users
- Building demos for investors
- Internal tools where "something cranky is better than nothing"
- Learning what features matter

But here's the critical point: **As soon as you're serious about production, let it go.**

The embarrassing truth? As an engineer, I wouldn't bring another developer onto a Lovable codebase. It's not about ego - it's about respect for their time and sanity. Engineers used to clean, sustainable setups find it painful to work in AI-generated chaos. In the Snacker case, Shelby had already burned through one developer who wasn't up to the task of untangling the mess before I came in to fix both the Lovable code AND the previous developer's attempts to work with it.

### The Clean Rebuild Reality

From real experience: a clean rebuild typically takes just 2-3 weeks and saves months of technical debt. Very rarely will you build something in Lovable so complex that an experienced developer can't recreate it properly in less time than you'll spend fighting the submodule approach.

The better path:
1. Use Lovable to validate your idea
2. Get user feedback and iterate quickly
3. Once you have product-market fit signals, hand the validated concept to an experienced developer
4. Let them build it right from the ground up
5. Keep the Lovable prototype as a reference, not as production code

### Finding the Right Partner

The key is finding someone who:
- Understands your problem domain
- Has built similar systems before
- Can explain trade-offs clearly
- Won't just execute but will advise and push back when needed

Otherwise, you'll make expensive mistakes that could have been avoided.

### Scale Considerations

If you're thinking in terms of:
- Hundreds or thousands of customers
- Features that Lovable can't handle
- Real-time operations
- Complex business logic
- Security and compliance requirements

**Don't try to force the Lovable-to-production path.** The technical debt will crush you.

## The Honest Advice for Founders

If someone came to me and said "I'm thinking about building my startup with Lovable," here's what I'd tell them:

"Yes, absolutely. Do it. Go for it. Try as best you can and see how far you can get. It's empowering, and I implore you to try."

But understand the reality: At some point, you will paint yourself into a corner and won't be able to get out. You'll find frustration, and in that frustration you'll lose motivation and momentum. No amount of discipline will get you out of a knowledge gap.

Use Lovable as an interactive prototyping tool. Get your ideas across. Use it for the exploratory process. It's more interactive than Figma, and that's fantastic. Show your developer what features should look like - that's incredibly valuable.

But don't believe the marketing that promises you can build anything. You'll end up making compromises that wouldn't exist if you brought in someone experienced from the start. When you hit frustrations and can't get where you want to be, remember: software engineering is a highly specialized job. We're paid well to solve problems with knowledge that's tough and difficult. You need an expert.

Don't rely on ChatGPT. Don't copy-paste solutions to your developers thinking you're on top of everything. I've seen it all. You have to trust your expert who has years of knowledge. As a founder, you're coming in as a guest into someone else's world.

## Conclusion

<Info>
**The bottom line**
There's a time and place for Lovable - it's an incredible prototyping tool. But production is a different game with different rules. Use the right tool for each job.
</Info>

This article shows you *can* take Lovable to production through creative workarounds. But after real-world experience, the honest recommendation is: **don't.**

Use Lovable for what it's great at - rapid prototyping and validation. When you're ready for production, invest in proper foundations. The short-term pain of a rebuild is nothing compared to the long-term agony of maintaining a house of cards.

Maybe this article will age like a wet sock in a couple of years. I hope so. But for now, the tools aren't there yet. They overpromise and underdeliver, and that ends up as a crappy experience for everyone involved.
