# Stop Doing Repetitive Work. Start Building Your Competitive Edge.

Your team spends 60-70% of their time on repetitive, monotonous tasks. Research compilation. Data entry. Report generation. Customer analysis. Process audits. The same workflows, repeated endlessly, burning out your best people who should be building the future.

As a challenger brand competing against companies 10x your size, you can't afford this inefficiency. You need every person focused on innovation, not administration. You need systems that multiply your team's impact, not just track their hours.

WithSeismic builds the internal tools and LLM-powered automation that eliminates this grunt work. We specialize in the advanced automation that gives smaller teams massive leverage—the kind of technical advantage that let [Contra scale their marketplace 5x](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation) and enabled [Vouchernaut to run 90% automated](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc).

Your competitors with 100+ person teams solve problems by throwing bodies at them. You solve them by building intelligent systems. That's your advantage—if you know how to leverage it.

## What We Actually Build

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chrome Extensions">
    **Real Example: [Indy.ai for Contra](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation)**

    We built a Chrome extension that turned 20,000+ users into a distributed discovery network. Each user's LinkedIn browsing contributes to a shared job marketplace. Result: 5x inventory growth in 2 weeks.

    **What else we build**:
    - Sales intelligence overlays that enrich any LinkedIn profile
    - [Analytics DevTools that reduced auditing time by 90%](/case-studies/growthrunner-devtools)
    - Competitive monitoring that tracks prices and inventory in real-time
    - Content extraction tools that work at scale

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="LLM Workflows">
    **Real Example: [Content Intelligence System](/case-studies/fingers-on-pulse-content-intelligence)**

    We built LLM workflows that process 800+ YouTube channels, transforming months of manual research into minutes of automated insights. What took 2.5 work weeks now takes 30 minutes—a 200x improvement.

    **What else we build**:
    - Document processing that handles 10,000+ files per hour
    - Quality assurance systems that catch more errors than manual review
    - Report generation that writes itself from raw data
    - Customer intelligence that identifies patterns humans miss

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Browser Automation">
    **Real Example: [Vouchernaut's PPC Automation](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc)**

    We built Playwright automation that managed 100,000+ brands across multiple platforms. Campaign creation went from 3-5 minutes to 10 seconds. VoucherCloud result: 60% of revenue from automated PPC, acquired by Groupon. Vouchernaut (my own business): 90% fully automated.

    **What else we build**:
    - Multi-platform campaign management
    - Report downloading from any analytics platform
    - Form submission and application automation
    - Testing and QA that runs 24/7

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MCP Servers">
    **The Future of AI Integration**

    [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](/build/mcp-servers) servers let AI assistants directly interact with your business systems. No more copy-pasting between ChatGPT and your tools—direct execution of complex workflows.

    **What we're building**:
    - Customer intelligence servers that query your CRM directly
    - Analytics servers that generate reports on demand
    - Development tools that let AI ship code
    - Sales operations that qualify and nurture automatically

  </Tab>

## How We're Different: The Intersection of Skills

### Technical MarTech + Product Engineering + Analytics

Most automation builders come from one discipline. We come from the intersection of three:

**Product Engineering**: We don't just write scripts—we build production systems that scale. Real products that generate real revenue, including Chrome extensions with tens of thousands of users.

**Technical MarTech**: Eight years optimizing growth systems. We understand conversion funnels, attribution models, and customer journeys. We've implemented growth strategies that drove significant customer acquisition across multiple startups.

**Analytics & Data**: We don't just move data—we understand it. From building analytics tracking for enterprise to creating intelligent reporting systems, we know how to turn data into competitive advantage.

This unique combination means we build automation that doesn't just work—it drives measurable business outcomes.

## Our Approach: Skunkworks Projects to Production Systems

### Week 1-2: Rapid Prototyping
We start with your biggest bottleneck and build a working prototype that proves the concept. Not slides or specs—actual working code that processes real data. This is our skunkworks approach: move fast, test assumptions, show results.

### Week 3-4: Production Hardening
Once proven, we transform the prototype into a production system. Error handling, scaling, monitoring—all the things that make automation reliable. We've shipped code for Sky, Groupon, and MIT. We know the difference between a demo and production.

### Week 5-6: Intelligence Layer
We enhance with LLM capabilities and advanced automation. This is where the magic happens—systems that understand context, adapt to changes, and handle edge cases.

### Week 7-8: Team Integration
We train your team and ensure adoption. The best automation is worthless if no one uses it. We make sure your team understands, trusts, and relies on what we build.

## The Compound Effect of Automation

<Info>
  When you eliminate repetitive work, three things happen: margins improve dramatically, team satisfaction increases, and you can scale operations without proportionally scaling headcount.
</Info>

**Immediate Impact**: Tasks that took days now take hours. Your team stops working weekends just to keep up with deliverables.

**Medium-term Growth**: With routine work automated, your team handles 2-3x more volume without burning out. Margins improve by 40-60%.

**Long-term Transformation**: Your internal tools become competitive moats. Some even become products themselves (like [Snacker.ai](/case-studies/snacker-ai-video-platform)). You've built IP assets that increase company valuation.

## Why Challenger Brands Choose WithSeismic

We specialize in the advanced automation that gives smaller teams massive leverage:

- **Chrome Extensions**: Like [Indy.ai](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation) with 20,000+ users creating network effects
- **LLM Workflows**: Like [Fingers on Pulse](/case-studies/fingers-on-pulse-content-intelligence) processing content 200x faster
- **Browser Automation**: Like [Vouchernaut](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc) managing 100,000+ brands
- **MCP Servers**: Direct AI-to-system connections that eliminate context switching

We don't build generic automation. We build the specific tools that multiply your team's unique expertise.

## The Path Forward for Challenger Brands

<Warning>
  **The automation gap is your opportunity**: While larger competitors debate AI strategy in committees, you can ship working automation in weeks. But this window won't stay open forever.
</Warning>

Every business reaches an inflection point where linear growth isn't enough. You need exponential leverage. That comes from:

1. **Eliminating repetitive work** so your team focuses on innovation
2. **Building intelligent systems** that scale without proportional costs
3. **Creating technical moats** that competitors can't easily replicate

The challenger brands building these advantages today become tomorrow's category leaders. See how in our [case studies](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation).

## Ready to Build Your Advantage?

We work with ambitious teams ready to transform how they operate. If you're tired of losing talented people to grunt work, competing on headcount instead of intelligence, and watching competitors with bigger teams move slower but win on resources—let's change that.
