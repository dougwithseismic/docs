## What's the Current Growth Engineering Opportunity?

<Info>
  **Quick Answer**: The window for technical advantage is now—while enterprises
  move slowly, you can deploy growth engineering systems in weeks and gain
  exponential growth through engineering leverage.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **The window for technical advantage is now**: While enterprises move slowly,
  you can deploy growth engineering systems in weeks. The speed advantage won't
  last forever.
</Warning>

Linear growth leads to linear outcomes. Exponential growth requires engineering leverage. The formula is straightforward:

1. **Engineer revenue systems** that generate growth 24/7 without human intervention
2. **Automate growth operations** to handle 10x volume at marginal cost
3. **Build technical moats** that transform how you compete in your market

The companies using growth engineering today are tomorrow's market leaders. They're not just automating tasks—they're engineering entirely new ways to grow. See the results in our [case studies](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation).

## How Do You Get Started With WithSeismic?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly is "growth engineering"?

Growth engineering is the practice of using software development and automation to solve growth problems. Instead of throwing more people at manual processes, we build systems that scale exponentially—like Chrome extensions that turn users into a distributed sales force or LLM workflows that process content 200x faster.

### How is WithSeismic different from traditional dev agencies?

Traditional agencies build what you ask for. We identify what will actually drive revenue growth. We combine engineering with deep marketing and product expertise, having built and sold our own automated businesses. We don't just code—we engineer growth.

### What size companies do you work with?

We primarily work with SaaS companies, marketplaces, and digital-first challenger brands doing $1M-$50M ARR. Companies that are too small for enterprise solutions but need sophisticated automation to compete with larger competitors.

### How long does a typical engagement take?

Our Growth Accelerator takes 2 weeks and solves one critical bottleneck. Our Revenue System takes 4 weeks and builds interconnected systems. Most clients see ROI within the first month of deployment.

### Do you require long-term contracts?

No. We work in focused sprints with clear deliverables. Our 2-week and 4-week engagements are project-based. Many clients return for additional projects, but there's no lock-in.

### What technologies do you specialize in?

Chrome extension development (React, TypeScript, MV3), LLM workflows (OpenAI, Claude, custom chains), browser automation (Playwright, Puppeteer), MCP servers, and modern web stack (Next.js, Node, Python).

### Can you work with our existing tech stack?

Yes. We've integrated with hundreds of different systems and APIs. Our solutions are designed to enhance your existing infrastructure, not replace it. We build bridges, not islands.

### How do you measure success?

We measure success by business impact: revenue increase, cost reduction, time saved, conversion improvement. Every project includes clear KPIs and measurement frameworks. Check our case studies for specific metrics.

### Do you provide ongoing support after delivery?

We deliver production-ready systems with documentation and handoff. We offer maintenance packages if needed, but our systems are built to be self-sustaining. We also train your team to manage and extend what we build.

### What if we don't know exactly what we need?

That's our specialty. We start with your business problems, not technical specifications. Our discovery process identifies the highest-impact opportunities, then we build solutions that deliver measurable results.

### What acquisition channels are you actively in on a daily basis?

We're active across both paid and organic channels. On the paid side, we run programmatic advertising through automated feeds across Meta, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Google Search. For organic, we create technical content on YouTube, build open-source tools on GitHub, and share growth engineering insights on LinkedIn. Everything is automated where possible—we practice what we preach, using the same programmatic and automation strategies we build for clients to drive our own growth.
