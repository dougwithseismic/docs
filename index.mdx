# Stop Doing Repetitive Work. Start Delivering Value.

Your team spends 60-70% of their time on repetitive, monotonous tasks. Research compilation. Data entry. Report generation. Customer analysis. Process audits. The same workflows, repeated endlessly, burning out your best people who should be doing strategic work.

Whether you're a B2B service scaling your operations, a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, or a consumer brand fighting for market share—you're facing the same problem: too much time on tasks that don't move the needle.

WithSeismic builds the internal tools and LLM-powered automation that eliminates this grunt work. We transform your manual processes into intelligent systems that handle the repetitive tasks, freeing your team to focus on the creative and strategic work that actually drives growth.

Your team didn't join your company to do data entry. They joined to solve problems, innovate, and deliver transformative results. But they're stuck doing work that machines should handle.

## What We Actually Build

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Internal Automation Tools">
    Custom tools that eliminate the repetitive work your team hates. Automated research gathering, data processing, report generation, quality checks—all the tasks that eat time but don't require human creativity.

    **Examples**:
    - A B2B service's competitive analysis that took 2 days now runs in 15 minutes
    - A marketplace's vendor onboarding that took hours now completes in minutes
    - An e-commerce brand's inventory forecasting that required daily manual updates now runs automatically

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Done-For-You Productization">
    Transform your service processes into products your team uses internally first. The same tools that make your team 10x more efficient become products you can offer to customers, partners, or clients.

    **Examples**:
    - An SEO audit tool becomes a self-service product for SMB customers
    - A marketplace's seller analytics dashboard becomes a premium feature
    - A brand's sizing recommendation engine becomes a white-label solution

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="LLM-Powered Workflows">
    Intelligent automation that goes beyond simple templates. LLMs that understand context, adapt to different scenarios, and handle the nuanced work that traditional automation can't touch.

    **Example**: An LLM agent that reviews creative briefs, extracts requirements, generates initial concepts, and prepares presentation decks—cutting project kickoff from days to hours.

## How Internal Tools Transform Your Business

### Before: Manual Everything

Your team spends Monday gathering data from 20 different sources. Tuesday organizing it into spreadsheets. Wednesday creating charts. Thursday writing analysis. Friday formatting reports. Five days for work that adds value only in the final insights.

This happens whether you're analyzing competitors, processing customer feedback, evaluating vendor performance, or tracking market trends.

### After: Focus on What Matters

Your team clicks one button. The tool gathers all data, analyzes patterns, generates visualizations, and creates a draft report in 30 minutes. Your team spends their time on what actually matters—interpreting results, developing strategies, and making decisions that drive growth.

The same work. 90% less time. 100% more focus on value creation.

## The Compound Effect of Automation

<Info>
  When you eliminate repetitive work, three things happen: margins improve
  dramatically, team satisfaction increases, and you can scale operations
  without proportionally scaling headcount.
</Info>

**Immediate Impact**: Tasks that took days now take hours. Your team stops working weekends just to keep up with deliverables.

**Medium-term Growth**: With routine work automated, your team handles 2-3x more volume without burning out. Margins improve by 40-60%.

**Long-term Transformation**: Your internal tools become products. Customers pay for self-service access. You've built IP assets that increase company valuation.

## Real Examples of What We Build

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Research & Intelligence Gathering">
    **Manual Process**: Analysts spend days searching websites, compiling data, creating summaries.

    **Our Solution**: LLM agents that automatically gather information from multiple sources, synthesize findings, identify patterns, and generate comprehensive research reports in minutes.

    **Result**: 95% reduction in research time, more comprehensive coverage, consistent quality.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reporting & Analytics Automation">
    **Manual Process**: Teams spend 10+ hours monthly per stakeholder pulling data, creating charts, writing narratives.

    **Our Solution**: Automated systems that pull data from all sources, generate visualizations, write performance narratives with LLMs, and distribute reports automatically.

    **Result**: Reports that took 10 hours now take 10 minutes. Your team focuses on insights and strategy, not spreadsheets.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quality Assurance Systems">
    **Manual Process**: Senior staff manually review all outputs, checking for errors, compliance, completeness.

    **Our Solution**: Automated QA tools that check for common issues, verify requirements, ensure consistency, and flag only items needing human review.

    **Result**: 80% fewer errors reach customers, 70% less time on reviews, teams learn faster with automated feedback.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sales & Proposal Automation">
    **Manual Process**: Sales teams spend days customizing proposals, pulling case studies, calculating pricing.

    **Our Solution**: LLM-powered system that generates customized proposals based on discovery notes, automatically includes relevant examples, and calculates optimal pricing.

    **Result**: Proposals in hours not days, more deals pursued, higher consistency in messaging.

## Our Development Approach

### Week 1-2: Process Mapping

We analyze your workflows to identify the repetitive tasks killing productivity. We look at where your team spends time, what they complain about, and what could be automated.

### Week 3-4: Tool Development

We build the first version of your internal tools. Real, working automation that your team can start using immediately. Not prototypes—functional tools that handle actual work.

### Week 5-6: LLM Integration

We enhance your tools with LLM capabilities. This is where the magic happens—tools that understand context, adapt to nuance, and handle complexity that traditional automation can't touch.

### Week 7-8: Productization Prep

We package your internal tools for potential external use. The same systems making your team efficient become products for clients who want DIY options.

## Why Teams Choose WithSeismic

We don't build generic automation. We build tools specifically for your workflows, with deep understanding of how modern businesses operate. We know the difference between work that needs human creativity and work that's just burning time.

Most importantly, we build tools your team will actually use. No complex platforms requiring months of training. Simple, powerful automation that works the way your team works.

## The Path to Freedom from Grunt Work

Every business reaches a point where growth means either hiring more people or working smarter. Hiring more people for repetitive work isn't the answer—it's expensive, hard to manage, and doesn't scale.

The answer is building internal tools that handle the repetitive work, letting your existing team focus on high-value activities. When your team spends time on strategy instead of spreadsheets, everyone wins—your team is happier, clients get better results, and your margins improve dramatically.

<Warning>
  **The cost of waiting**: Every month you delay automation, you're burning
  $20-40K in wasted productivity per team member. That's budget that could be
  invested in growth instead of grunt work.
</Warning>
