(╯°□°)╯︵ ƃuıʇǝʞɹɐɯ WithSeismic is a boutique growth engineering consultancy where code meets revenue. We partner with modern SaaS, marketplaces, and digital-first brands to solve their hardest growth problems through engineering—bridging the gap between technical capability and business outcomes.

We're the translators between business problems and technical solutions, with the entrepreneurial experience to know what actually drives growth. Whether it's turning 20,000 users into a distributed discovery network for [Contra](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation), or building programmatic systems that drove 60% of revenue for [Vouchercloud Groupon](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc), we engineer solutions that give challenger brands unfair advantages.

Your team is drowning in manual processes—60-70% of their time spent on repetitive work instead of strategic initiatives. Meanwhile, your growth is constrained not by market opportunity but by operational capacity. We bridge this gap with growth engineering that transforms how you acquire customers, optimize operations, and scale revenue.

We combine engineering, marketing, and product thinking—that's why we can build what others can't, like [Contra's](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation) Chrome extension turning 20,000 users into a distributed sales force.

## What We Actually Build

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chrome Extensions">
    **Real Example: [Indy.ai for Contra](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation)**

    We built a Chrome extension that turned 20,000+ users into a distributed discovery network. Each user's LinkedIn browsing contributes to a shared job marketplace. Result: massive inventory growth.

    **What else we build**:
    - Sales intelligence overlays that enrich any LinkedIn profile
    - [Analytics DevTools that reduced auditing time by 90%](/case-studies/growthrunner-devtools)
    - Competitive monitoring that tracks prices and inventory in real-time
    - Content extraction tools that work at scale

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="LLM Workflows">
    **Real Example: [Content Intelligence System](/case-studies/fingers-on-pulse-content-intelligence)**

    We built LLM workflows that process 800+ YouTube channels, transforming months of manual research into minutes of automated insights. What took 2.5 work weeks now takes 30 minutes—a 200x improvement.

    **What else we build**:
    - Document processing that handles 10,000+ files per hour
    - Quality assurance systems that catch more errors than manual review
    - Report generation that writes itself from raw data
    - Customer intelligence that identifies patterns humans miss

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Browser Automation">
    **Real Example: [Vouchernaut's PPC Automation](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc)**

    We built Playwright automation that managed 100,000+ brands across multiple platforms. Campaign creation went from 3-5 minutes to 10 seconds. Vouchercloud Groupon result: 60% of revenue from automated PPC. Vouchernaut (my own business): 90% fully automated.

    **What else we build**:
    - Multi-platform campaign management
    - Report downloading from any analytics platform
    - Form submission and application automation
    - Testing and QA that runs 24/7

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MCP Servers">
    **The Future of AI Integration**

    [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](/build/mcp-servers) servers let AI assistants directly interact with your business systems. No more copy-pasting between ChatGPT and your tools—direct execution of complex workflows.

    **What we're building**:
    - Customer intelligence servers that query your CRM directly
    - Analytics servers that generate reports on demand
    - Development tools that let AI ship code
    - Sales operations that qualify and nurture automatically

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Intersection That Matters

Most automation builders come from one discipline. We come from the intersection of three:

**Product Engineering**: We build real products that generate real revenue. Chrome extensions with tens of thousands of users. Production systems handling millions of operations. Check the [case studies](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation).

**Technical MarTech**: Over a decade optimizing growth systems. Conversion funnels, attribution models, customer journeys. Growth strategies that drove significant customer acquisition across multiple startups.

**Analytics & Data**: We turn data into competitive advantage. Built analytics tracking for enterprise. Created intelligent reporting systems that identify patterns humans miss.

This unique combination creates automation that drives measurable business outcomes.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Compound Effect of Growth Engineering

<Info>
  Growth engineering creates cascading advantages: each system amplifies the
  next, compound revenue gains accelerate over time, and technical capabilities
  become competitive moats.
</Info>

**Immediate Revenue Impact**: Launch campaigns in seconds instead of hours. Process leads 24/7 without human intervention. Turn manual workflows into revenue-generating systems.

**Scaling Without Constraints**: Handle 10x volume with the same team. Enter new markets without proportional cost increases. Transform fixed costs into variable revenue drivers.

**Strategic Transformation**: Your growth systems become intellectual property. Technical advantages compound into market dominance. What starts as automation becomes your core competitive advantage—like how [Snacker.ai](/case-studies/snacker-ai-video-platform) evolved from an internal tool to a standalone product.

- **MCP Servers**: Direct AI-to-system connections that eliminate context switching

We don't build generic automation. We build the specific tools that multiply your team's unique expertise.

## The Growth Engineering Opportunity

<Warning>
  **The window for technical advantage is now**: While enterprises move slowly,
  you can deploy growth engineering systems in weeks. This speed advantage won't
  last forever.
</Warning>

Linear growth leads to linear outcomes. Exponential growth requires engineering leverage. The formula is straightforward:

1. **Engineer revenue systems** that generate growth 24/7 without human intervention
2. **Automate growth operations** to handle 10x volume at marginal cost
3. **Build technical moats** that transform how you compete in your market

The companies using growth engineering today are tomorrow's market leaders. They're not just automating tasks—they're engineering entirely new ways to grow. See the results in our [case studies](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation).

## Ready to Build Your Advantage?

We work with ambitious teams ready to transform how they operate. If you're tired of losing talented people to grunt work, competing on headcount instead of intelligence, and watching competitors with bigger teams move slower but win on resources—let's change that.
