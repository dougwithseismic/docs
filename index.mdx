## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who do you work with?">
    SaaS companies and marketplaces doing $300K-$5M ARR. Teams with revenue problems that require custom engineering solutions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes this different from hiring a dev agency?">
    Revenue focus, not just feature development. We've built and sold our own products. Shipped code that drove company acquisitions and 60% of revenue. We focus on bottom-line impact, not technical perfection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do you only take 3 clients per quarter?">
    Quality over quantity. Each client gets direct access to senior engineering, not junior developers learning on your dime. We limit capacity to ensure we can deliver transformation, not just features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the investment?">
    $7,500/month minimum over 3 months ($22,500 total). Discovery, then building and deploying tools throughout the engagement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you require long-term contracts?">
    No. Focused projects with clear deliverables. Ongoing work available but not required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about ongoing support?">
    Production-ready systems with documentation and training. Maintenance available if needed, but built to be self-sustaining.

  <Accordion title="Can you work with our existing systems?">
    Yes. Built to integrate with what you have.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if we're not sure what we need?">
    Start with the problem, not the solution. Discovery process identifies what will have the most impact.
  </Accordion>
