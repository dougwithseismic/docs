## The Problem We Solve

Your product is too complex to explain on a landing page but too risky for prospects to commit without proof. You need interactive demos, light product versions, and engagement tools that let prospects experience value before the sales call—but here's the problem:

Marketers don't code. Engineers don't think in revenue. Marketing agencies outsource the dev work (adding weeks and markup). Dev shops build beautiful features that don't convert.

## What We Actually Build

WithSeismic specializes in one thing: **interactive experiences that convert browsers into buyers**. We don't rebuild your website. We don't redesign your funnel. We build focused, high-impact tools that give prospects that "aha!" moment before they ever talk to sales:

- **Interactive Product Demos** - Let prospects click through your actual UI, experience your workflow, and see their own data transformed—no signup, no sales call, just instant value demonstration
- **Lightweight Product Experiences** - Stripped-down versions of your core features that prospects can use immediately, giving them a real taste of your product's power in under 60 seconds
- **Head-to-Head Comparisons** - Interactive tools that let prospects input their specific requirements and see exactly why you're the better choice, with real calculations and live examples
- **Workflow Simulators** - Show prospects their exact process optimized with your solution, calculating real time savings based on their actual volumes and use cases
- **Developer Sandboxes** - Let technical buyers test your API with their own data, see response times, and validate integrations without provisioning anything

We're growth engineers—we combine the revenue focus of a Head of Growth with the technical execution of senior engineers. Every tool we build is designed to create that moment where a prospect thinks "I need this now," not after three more demos.

## Why We're Different

**Doug Silkstone, Founder**

With a previous life as Head of Growth handling MarTech and analytics, followed by eight years of fullstack engineering and consultancy, Doug is uniquely positioned to identify what interactive experience will move the needle AND build it fast enough to matter.

This rare combination has attracted clients like [MIT](https://mit.edu), [Sky](https://sky.com) (Performance Marketing Award winner), TOPSHOP, [The Motley Fool](https://fool.com), and [STRV](https://strv.com). His voice-to-ChatGPT extension Promptheus (40,000+ users) became an official MIT course assignment. As a founder, he built and sold multiple startups including Vouchernaut—driving 150k+ new customers and securing £1.3M in sales at 17x ROI.

The track record speaks for itself: we don't just build features, we build growth engines. We don't just write code, we write code that converts.

## How We Work: Growth Engineering in Practice

We run on 2-week or 4-week sprints because growth compounds—the faster you ship and measure, the faster you grow. Every project follows our growth engineering framework:

**Week 0 (Pre-Sprint)**: A 90-minute alignment workshop where we define the ONE metric that matters. Not vanity metrics, not feature lists—the actual number that drives revenue. Doug runs these personally, bringing both the growth mindset and technical feasibility to the table.

**Week 1**: From concept to working prototype with daily progress updates. This isn't a mockup—it's functional code with tracking already baked in. By Friday, clients are testing their growth mechanism with real user flows and seeing actual data.

**Week 2**: Optimization and instrumentation. Every click, every conversion, every drop-off point gets measured. We optimize for both performance (sub-second loads) and growth (conversion at every step). The tool moves to production with full analytics from day one.

**Week 3-4** (If 4-week sprint): Advanced growth features like A/B testing frameworks, attribution tracking, CRM integrations, or multi-channel campaigns. This is where we build the infrastructure for continuous optimization—because launch is just the beginning of growth, not the end.

## The Business Model

WithSeismic's pricing is refreshingly simple:

- **2-Week Thin Slice Sprint**: $6,000 (one core user flow, basic analytics)
- **4-Week Full Sprint**: $12,000 (multiple flows, integrations, advanced analytics)
- **Interactive Demo Build**: $8,000-$20,000 (depending on complexity)
- **Ongoing Optimization**: $3,000/month retainer (only offered after initial sprint)

They require 50% upfront and 50% on delivery. No negotiation, no custom scoping. If you need something different, you're not their client.

The average client lifetime value is $22,000, with 40% coming back for additional tools or retainer work. Their close rate from qualified discovery calls is 38%, well above industry standards because they pre-qualify heavily.

## Marketing & Sales Approach

WithSeismic generates pipeline through three channels:

**Direct Outreach (40% of revenue)**: They run targeted campaigns via Apollo.io, sending 100 personalized emails per week to growth leaders at B2B SaaS companies between $1M-$50M ARR. Their reply rate averages 12% by focusing on specific triggers like funding rounds or feature launches.

**Content & SEO (35% of revenue)**: Their Interactive Demo Playbook has been downloaded 800+ times and feeds a 6-part nurture sequence. They publish detailed teardowns of interactive experiences that rank for "[competitor] interactive demo" searches.

**Referrals & Partnerships (25% of revenue)**: Previous clients and three key agency partners who lack technical implementation capabilities. They pay 10% revenue share on referrals that close.

## Our Interactive Tools Philosophy

We operate on principles that make interactive tools actually work for growth:

**"Show, don't tell"**: Every tool we build lets prospects experience your value proposition hands-on. No more hoping they'll understand from a demo video or sales deck.

**"Measure engagement, not just visits"**: Our tools track every interaction—which calculator fields get used, where demos get abandoned, what comparisons drive conversions. This data becomes your growth roadmap.

**"The thin slice that converts"**: We're ruthless about scope. Better to nail one interactive experience that moves the needle than build three features nobody uses.

**"Ship interactive, ship fast"**: The best interactive demo live today beats the perfect one in development next quarter. We ship working tools in weeks because that's when you need pipeline, not months from now.

## Operations & Tooling

The agency runs on a surprisingly lean tech stack:
- **Communication**: Slack + Google Meet
- **Development**: TypeScript, React, Node.js
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub, Vercel, shared component library
- **Analytics**: Segment → everything else
- **CRM**: HubSpot
- **Outreach**: Apollo.io

We maintain a library of 50+ pre-built components that can be assembled into new tools quickly. An interactive demo that would take 200 hours from scratch takes us 40 hours using our systems.

## Financial Performance

While private about exact figures, available data suggests:
- **Annual Revenue Run Rate**: ~$400K (Year 2)
- **Profit Margins**: ~45% after contractor costs
- **Client Concentration**: No client exceeds 15% of revenue
- **Cash Cycle**: 21 days average from invoice to payment
- **Pipeline Coverage**: Maintain 3x quarterly target

## What Clients Actually Say

We've delivered 56+ projects that help companies generate real results.

**Brian Tighe, Head Of Technology @ [Fool.com](https://fool.com)**
*"Doug is a pro. I'd hire him again for any future marketing & technology initiatives."*

**Shelby Stevens, Founder @ [Snacker.ai](https://snacker.ai)**
*"They're smart, fast, and trustworthy!"*

**Allison Nulty, Head of Product @ [Contra](https://contra.com)**
*"Doug was incredible to work with and a great communicator. He operated quickly & efficiently, and even proposed ways to improve the feature to exceed our expectations. 10/10!"*

## The Challenges They Face

WithSeismic isn't without its struggles:

1. **Scaling beyond Doug**: Most strategic decisions and sales still run through the founder. We're actively trying to hire a second principal consultant but haven't found the right mix of technical and commercial skills. If you know someone in this space that's looking for a unique mission to help challenger brands blow up, send them to hello@withseismic.com.

2. **Feast or famine sprints**: The 2-4 week sprint model creates lumpy revenue. They're working on more retainer relationships to smooth cashflow.

3. **Saying no to scope creep**: Clients love the first tool so much they want WithSeismic to rebuild everything. Maintaining focus on "sidecars only" requires constant discipline.

## Where They're Heading

WithSeismic is doubling down on what works:

- Building a certification program for other agencies to license their methodology
- Developing a SaaS product that lets marketing teams deploy simple interactive demos without code
- Expanding into Europe where PLG adoption is 18 months behind the US
- Creating industry-specific interactive demo templates (FinTech, DevTools, DataOps)

The goal is to hit $1M ARR by Year 3 while maintaining their boutique positioning. They'd rather be the best at one thing than mediocre at many.

## Why Interactive Tools Win

In B2B sales, the biggest drop-off happens between "interesting" and "convinced." Your prospects need to experience value, not just read about it.

Traditional agencies give you strategy decks about building interactive experiences. Dev shops build beautiful features that take six months. We ship working interactive tools in 2-4 weeks that actually move prospects through your funnel.

Our clients don't hire us to rebuild products or run campaigns. They hire us to solve one specific problem: prospects don't understand the product's value until it's too late in the sales cycle.

Every interactive tool we build answers one question: "What would make someone say 'holy shit, I need this' before they ever talk to sales?"

That focus on interactive experiences, combined with our growth engineering approach (revenue thinking + technical execution), has made us the go-to partner for B2B companies that need to demonstrate value fast—both in their sales cycle and in our delivery timeline.
