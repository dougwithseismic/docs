## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What types of businesses do you work with?">
    We primarily work with SaaS companies, marketplaces, and digital-first challenger brands doing $300K-$5M ARR. Companies that need sophisticated automation to compete with larger competitors but want to move fast without enterprise complexity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from hiring a traditional dev agency?">
    Traditional agencies build what you ask for. We identify what will actually drive revenue growth. We combine deep technical expertise with marketing and product knowledge, having built and sold our own automated businesses. We don't just codeâ€”we engineer growth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's your typical timeline and investment?">
    Our Growth Gap Discovery takes 2 weeks ($6,000) to comprehensively audit your growth fundamentals, identify critical gaps, and provide a detailed roadmap for the low-hanging fruit and must-haves missing from your growth machine. Most clients see immediate value from the actionable insights we deliver.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you require long-term contracts?">
    We work in focused sprints with clear deliverables. Our 2-week Growth Gap Discovery is project-based with options for implementation support and ongoing partnership available for clients who want to execute on our recommendations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if we need ongoing support?">
    We deliver production-ready systems with documentation and handoff. We offer maintenance packages if needed, but our systems are built to be self-sustaining. We also train your team to manage and extend what we build.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you measure success?">
    We measure success by business impact: revenue increase, cost reduction, time saved, conversion improvement. Every project includes clear KPIs and measurement frameworks. Check our case studies for specific metrics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What technologies do you specialize in?">
    Chrome extension development (React, TypeScript, MV3), LLM workflows (OpenAI, Claude, custom chains), browser automation (Playwright, Puppeteer), MCP servers, and modern web stack (Next.js, Node, Python).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you work with our existing tech stack?">
    Yes. We've integrated with hundreds of different systems and APIs. Our solutions are designed to enhance your existing infrastructure, not replace it. We build bridges, not islands.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if we don't know exactly what we need?">
    That's our specialty. We start with your business problems, not technical specifications. Our discovery process identifies the highest-impact opportunities, then we build solutions that deliver measurable results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can we get started?">
    We typically respond within 4 hours during business hours. Most projects can start within a week of our initial conversation. The next sprint could begin as early as Monday.
  </Accordion>
