# AI-Native Engineering for Digital Brands

We're an AI-native development team building Chrome extensions, automation systems, and MVPs using Cursor, Claude, and modern tooling. Production code that handles real scale—20,000+ users, 100,000+ automated processes, systems that go from prototype to paying customers in weeks, not months.

Founded by Doug Silkstone. We've shipped for Contra, Groupon, Motley Fool, and NOWTV. Built automation systems that contributed to company acquisitions. AI-assisted development means faster iteration, better code, and products that ship.

  **$7,500/month** (3-month minimum: $22,500 total). AI-accelerated development means you get more, faster.
</Card>

## Why AI-Native Matters

**Faster iteration cycles** - What used to take weeks now takes days. We use Cursor and Claude to write, test, and refactor code at speeds traditional development can't match.

**Better code quality** - AI catches edge cases, suggests optimizations, and maintains consistency across large codebases. We review and refine, but start from a higher baseline.

**Rapid prototyping** - Test ideas in hours, not weeks. AI-assisted development means we can explore multiple approaches and iterate based on real feedback.

**More for your budget** - Speed compounds. The time we save on boilerplate and debugging goes into solving your actual problems.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who do you work with?">
    SaaS companies, marketplaces, and digital brands doing $300K-$5M ARR. Teams that need custom tools but want to move quickly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes this different from hiring a dev agency?">
    AI-native development with real production experience. We've built and sold our own products, and use Cursor/Claude daily. Growth engineering focus, not just feature development. We ship faster and deliver more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'AI-native' actually mean?">
    We use AI tools (Cursor, Claude) as our primary development environment. This means faster iteration, better code consistency, and more time spent solving your actual problems instead of debugging syntax. We review and refine everything, but start from a much higher baseline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the investment?">
    $7,500/month minimum over 3 months ($22,500 total). Discovery, then building and deploying tools throughout the engagement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you require long-term contracts?">
    No. Focused projects with clear deliverables. Ongoing work available but not required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about ongoing support?">
    Production-ready systems with documentation and training. Maintenance available if needed, but built to be self-sustaining.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you measure success?">
    Business impact: revenue, cost reduction, time saved, conversions. Clear KPIs for each project. See case studies for specifics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's your tech stack?">
    Chrome extensions (React, TypeScript, MV3), LLM workflows (OpenAI, Claude), browser automation (Playwright, Puppeteer), MCP servers, web apps (Next.js, Node, Python).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you work with our existing systems?">
    Yes. Built to integrate with what you have.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if we're not sure what we need?">
    Start with the problem, not the solution. Discovery process identifies what will have the most impact.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can we start?">
    Usually respond within 4 hours. Most projects start within a week.
  </Accordion>
