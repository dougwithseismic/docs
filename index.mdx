<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What types of businesses do you work with?">
    We primarily work with SaaS companies, marketplaces, and digital-first challenger brands doing $300K-$5M ARR. Companies that need sophisticated automation to compete with larger competitors but want to move fast without enterprise complexity.
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="How is this different from hiring a traditional dev agency?">
  Traditional agencies build what you ask for. We identify what will actually
  drive revenue growth. We combine deep technical expertise with marketing and
  product knowledge, having built and sold our own automated businesses. We
  don't just codeâ€”we engineer growth.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="What's your typical timeline and investment?">
  Our Solution Discovery ($6,000) is a two-week audit combining product, growth,
  marketing, and engineering perspectives. We provide a detailed roadmap of what
  to build and how to grow. Most clients see immediate value from the actionable
  insights we deliver.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="Do you require long-term contracts?">
  We work in focused sprints with clear deliverables. Our Solution Discovery is
  project-based with options for implementation support and ongoing partnership
  available for clients who want to execute on our recommendations.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="What happens if we need ongoing support?">
  We deliver production-ready systems with documentation and handoff. We offer
  maintenance packages if needed, but our systems are built to be
  self-sustaining. We also train your team to manage and extend what we build.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="How do you measure success?">
  We measure success by business impact: revenue increase, cost reduction, time
  saved, conversion improvement. Every project includes clear KPIs and
  measurement frameworks. Check our case studies for specific metrics.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="What technologies do you specialize in?">
  Chrome extension development (React, TypeScript, MV3), LLM workflows (OpenAI,
  Claude, custom chains), browser automation (Playwright, Puppeteer), MCP
  servers, and modern web stack (Next.js, Node, Python).
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="Can you work with our existing tech stack?">
  Yes. We've integrated with hundreds of different systems and APIs. Our
  solutions are designed to enhance your existing infrastructure, not replace
  it. We build bridges, not islands.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="What if we don't know exactly what we need?">
  That's our specialty. We start with your business problems, not technical
  specifications. Our discovery process identifies the highest-impact
  opportunities, then we build solutions that deliver measurable results.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can we get started?">
    We typically respond within 4 hours during business hours. Most projects can start within a week of our initial conversation. The next sprint could begin as early as Monday.
