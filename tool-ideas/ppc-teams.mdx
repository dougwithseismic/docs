## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which PPC automation tool should we build first?">
    Start with the tool that solves your biggest daily pain point. Most teams benefit from automated reporting first (saves 2-3 hours daily), followed by bulk ad copy generation for new campaigns, then search term mining for ongoing optimization. Pick the one that wastes the most time currently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much development time do these tools typically require?">
    Simple tools like URL parameter builders take 1-2 weeks, while complex systems like automated bid management can take 2-3 months. Most reporting and analysis tools fall in the 3-6 week range. The ROI justifies the investment when tools save 5+ hours weekly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do these tools work with all PPC platforms?">
    Most tools can be built to work with Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Microsoft Ads, and LinkedIn Ads through their respective APIs. Some features are platform-specific, but core functionality like reporting, bulk operations, and analysis work across platforms with proper API integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do automated bid management systems compare to platform automation?">
    Custom automation allows for complex rules that platforms don't support - like adjusting bids based on weather, inventory levels, competitor actions, or custom business metrics. Platform automation handles basics well, but custom systems excel at unique business requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the ROI timeline for building these automation tools?">
    Simple tools often pay for themselves within 2-3 months through time savings. Complex automation systems typically break even within 6-12 months. The ongoing savings compound as you manage more accounts and campaigns with the same team size.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate is AI-generated ad copy compared to human-written copy?">
    AI-generated copy typically performs 80-90% as well as expert human copy but can be generated 100x faster. The key is using AI for volume and variations, then human review for final optimization. Many successful campaigns use AI for initial creation, then human refinement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data sources are needed for these automation tools?">
    Most tools require API access to your ad platforms (Google Ads API, Facebook Marketing API), Google Analytics for conversion data, and your CRM for revenue attribution. Advanced tools may integrate with weather APIs, inventory systems, or competitor intelligence tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you ensure quality control with automated campaign management?">
    Implement approval workflows for significant changes, set spending limits and safety checks, maintain change logs for all automated actions, and include human review for new campaigns or unusual situations. Start with automation that suggests changes rather than implementing them automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can these tools help with compliance and ad policy issues?">
    Yes, pre-launch checklist automation can scan for common policy violations, trademark issues, and compliance problems before ads go live. Quality assurance tools can check landing page compliance, ad copy against industry regulations, and targeting restrictions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the maintenance requirement for PPC automation tools?">
    Expect 2-4 hours monthly for simple tools, and 5-10 hours monthly for complex systems. Most maintenance involves updating API integrations when platforms change, adjusting rules based on performance data, and expanding functionality as needs grow.
