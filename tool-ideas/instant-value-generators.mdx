## The Try-Before-You-Buy Model

Instead of selling your services, let prospects experience them. Build lightweight versions of your tools that prospects can use on their own websites - no sales call required.

<Note>
The magic: When prospects see immediate value from your free tool, they naturally want the full service. You've already proven ROI before the first conversation.
</Note>

<Note>
