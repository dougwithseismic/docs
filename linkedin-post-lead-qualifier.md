Signal to noise.

Every MarTech site does the same mating dance. Gated content. Demo walls. Forms everywhere.

I went the opposite way with withSeismic.com. Everything's free.

But I still offer services. And I need to know what helps.

So I track what people use:
• Which tools open
• Which docs finish
• Which code copies
• How long on each topic

It's in your browser's localStorage. Open console. Type `WithSeismicTracker.getProfile()`. See what I see.

Hit an engagement threshold? I get a ping: "someone spent 20 minutes with the ROI calculator."

This tells me:
1. What content to make more of
2. Who might benefit from talking

No forms. Value first. Track what's valuable. Connect when it matters.

Implementation: Event listeners. JavaScript object. Update scores. Both sides know when there's real engagement.
