## The Challenge

GrowthMatch, a TechStars alumni company, had successfully pivoted into a done-for-you video concierge service. They would record, help with case studies, generate content ideas, edit videos, and deliver polished content ready for publication.

However, like traditional agencies, they faced a critical scaling challenge:
- High overhead costs for manual video editing and production
- Limited capacity to serve multiple clients simultaneously
- Unable to scale without proportionally increasing headcount
- Clients' team members couldn't collaborate on content creation

They needed a self-service solution that could maintain their quality standards while enabling massive scale.

## The Solution

I was brought in to transform a Lovable prototype into Snacker.ai - a production-ready, AI-powered DIY video platform that would complement GrowthMatch's concierge service.

Snacker.ai became a standalone SaaS that enabled GrowthMatch to:
- Offer a self-service tier for budget-conscious clients
- Enable team collaboration through Snacker for Teams
- Scale revenue without scaling headcount
- Create an upsell funnel to their premium services

## Technical Implementation

### Starting Point
- Inherited a Lovable prototype that needed production-ready architecture
- Required complete AI integration and video processing pipeline

### Tech Stack
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: Vite + React
- **Backend**: Hono framework
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Video Processing**: Web Codecs API + HLS playlist generation
- **AI Integration**: LLM APIs for content generation and editing

### Technical Innovations

**Real-Time Browser Video Editing**: Solved the challenge of video editing in the browser by combining:
- Web Codecs for efficient video processing
- HLS playlist generation for streaming
- Workarounds for iOS mobile audio playback restrictions

## The AI-Powered Workflow

### Three Pillars of AI Integration

1. **Content Ideation**
   - AI-generated talking points and prompts
   - Topic suggestions based on audience and goals
   - Session planning and content calendars
   - Personalized content strategies

2. **Automatic Video Editing**
   - Removes gaps, pauses, and mistakes automatically
   - Creates coherent takes from raw recordings
   - Accepts feedback for re-editing
   - Produces polished videos in seconds

3. **Content Distribution**
   - Generates platform-specific captions and descriptions
   - One-click publishing to LinkedIn, X, YouTube
   - Creates blog posts and articles from video content
   - Publishes to Snacker's own content platform

## Key Features

- **Teleprompter & Notes**: Built-in teleprompter with LLM-powered script assistance
- **Zero-UI Video Editing**: Hidden complexity - users just record and share
- **20-Second Turnaround**: From recording end to rendered, shareable video
- **Team Collaboration**: Invite teammates to work on content together
- **Multi-Platform Export**: Optimized content for every social platform

## Timeline & Development

- **Project Duration**: 3 months
- **Starting Point**: Lovable prototype
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready SaaS with paying customers

## Results & Impact

### User Acquisition (3 months)
- **20 paying customers** acquired
- **5,000+ free users** onboarded
- Created natural upsell funnel to GrowthMatch's premium services

### Product-Market Fit
- Validated the "done for you" video editing concept
- Proved demand for simplified video content creation
- Successfully bridged DIY and concierge service models

### Business Transformation
- Enabled GrowthMatch to scale beyond traditional agency model
- Created recurring SaaS revenue stream
- Reduced customer acquisition costs through self-service tier
- Increased lifetime value through service upsells

## What Made Snacker Different

Unlike traditional video editing tools, Snacker eliminated the entire editing interface. Users simply:
1. Sit down to record
2. Get AI-powered guidance on what to say
3. Record their video with teleprompter support
4. Receive a polished, edited video 20 seconds later
5. Share with one click to any platform

The "done for you" philosophy meant hiding all traditional video editing complexity while maintaining professional output quality.

## Lessons Learned

- **Simplification is innovation**: Removing features (traditional editing UI) can be more valuable than adding them
- **AI as invisible assistant**: The best AI implementations work behind the scenes
- **Speed matters**: 20-second turnaround changed user behavior and expectations
- **Hybrid models work**: Combining SaaS with services creates powerful growth loops
