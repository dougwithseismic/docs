## How It Started

My journey to getBenson began at VoucherCloud, which later got acquired by Groupon. Working in the voucher publishing space gave me a unique vantage point to see both sides of the Honey problem.

As a Honey user myself, we witnessed firsthand how extensions earned affiliate commissions without providing real value. The codes often didn't work, yet brands were still paying for these failed conversions.

The problem ran deeper than just broken codes. The affiliate industry had a built-in conflict of interest: networks earned kickbacks from every Honey transaction, creating a powerful incentive to stay silent about the damage. B2C brands were left in the dark, lacking the critical data needed to understand whether these extensions helped or hurt their business.

My unique position - understanding both the affiliate space and having the technical capability to build a solution - made the opportunity clear.

## Understanding the Problem

Every e-commerce store faces an invisible profit leak: browser extensions like Honey, Capital One Shopping, and Rakuten that auto-apply discount codes at checkout. While marketed as "helping consumers save money," these extensions create significant problems for online retailers:

### The Hidden Cost of Discount Extensions

- **Margin Erosion**: Extensions apply codes meant for specific customer segments (email subscribers, first-time buyers) to everyone
- **Affiliate Commission Hijacking**: Extensions claim last-click attribution even when they didn't drive the sale
- **Cart Abandonment**: When extensions can't find codes, they tell customers "better deals exist elsewhere"
- **Destroyed Pricing Strategy**: Carefully planned promotions become universal discounts
- **Brand Devaluation**: Training customers to never pay full price

The numbers are staggering:

- 100+ million users have Honey installed
- Average margin loss: 12-15% per transaction
- Affiliate commission theft: $2.4B annually across e-commerce
- Cart abandonment increase: 23% when no codes found

## The Breaking Point

Consider this scenario: A DTC brand spends $50,000 on influencer marketing, offering exclusive 20% off codes to track ROI. But when customers reach checkout:

1. Honey pops up and applies the influencer code automatically
2. Honey claims the affiliate commission (2-8% of sale)
3. The brand loses both the discount margin AND pays commission to Honey
4. The influencer partnership ROI becomes impossible to track
5. Future influencers refuse to promote without higher rates

This pattern repeats across email campaigns, loyalty programs, and strategic partnerships.

## Building the Solution

Before building, we researched existing solutions. While a couple existed, none offered comprehensive protection. My vision crystallized around three core questions: Could I reliably detect these extensions? Could I prevent them from interfering? Could I help brands reclaim their lost margin?

With clients from my affiliate network already expressing frustration about this problem, the decision to build getBenson was obvious.

I built getBenson as the first comprehensive defense system against discount extension parasites. Instead of accepting these losses as "cost of doing business," getBenson blocks extensions from interfering with checkout flows entirely.

### The Technical Challenge

Building getBenson in 2018 meant entering an evolving cat-and-mouse game between extensions and detection methods.

The technical challenge was formidable. Each extension operated differently - some ran in the main execution context, others in isolated environments. We had to navigate the complex security boundaries of browser architecture, leveraging features like Shadow DOM to create protected zones that extensions couldn't penetrate.

My process was iterative and challenging. We experimented with countless detection strategies, each iteration teaching me more about the delicate balance between functionality and security. The key insight: maintaining strict separation between the extension world and my protected checkout environment was non-negotiable.

The breakthrough came when I approached the problem like reverse engineering an application. By detecting specific files that extensions exposed through the browser's API, we could create unique fingerprints for each extension - definitively identifying whether Honey, Retail Me Not, Rakuten, or others were active on the page.

### How It Works

**Detection Layer**

- API-based fingerprinting of exposed extension files
- Real-time identification of 50+ discount extensions
- Browser-level detection that extensions can't hide from

**Protection Layer**

- Shadow DOM implementation for checkout isolation
- Blocks extension access to protected elements
- Maintains separation between extension and checkout worlds
- Preserves normal checkout flow for legitimate customers

**Intelligence Layer**

- Analytics dashboard for impact measurement
- Extension usage tracking by customer segment
- A/B testing capabilities for measuring true impact
- ROI tracking on protection implementation

## Implementation

getBenson integrates seamlessly with any e-commerce platform:

### Platform Support

**Shopify/Shopify Plus**

- Automatic theme integration
- Compatible with all checkout flows

**WooCommerce**

- WordPress plugin available
- Hooks into checkout process
- Full compatibility with payment gateways

**Custom Platforms**

- Custom rules engine for specific scenarios

## Finding the First Customers

Theory11, a premium playing card brand, became my first client. They had already experienced Honey's devastating impact on their margins and tried other solutions without success. For them, getBenson was an immediate necessity.

Through customer conversations, we discovered two distinct buyer personas:

**The Immediate Blockers** had clear urgency: "Block these extensions now - we're hemorrhaging margin." They understood the problem and wanted immediate protection.

**The Data-Driven Analysts** took a measured approach: "Before blocking anything, we need to understand the true impact." This feedback pushed me to evolve getBenson beyond simple blocking into a comprehensive analytics platform that could quantify exactly how much these extensions were costing.

This insight shaped getBenson's evolution from pure blocking tool to comprehensive analytics platform.

## Results & Impact

## The Unexpected End

Shopify's decision to block all third-party scripts from their checkout process brought getBenson's journey to an abrupt end.

This was before Shopify's sweeping changes to allow checkout extensions - a platform decision that fundamentally changed what was possible in the e-commerce protection space.

## What I Learned

Looking back, we see a different path.

**From adversarial to analytical.** If I were building getBenson today, I'd take a fundamentally different approach. Rather than positioning myself as an adversary to discount extensions, I'd focus on objective impact analysis. The question wouldn't be "How do we block them?" but "What's the actual ROI of these partnerships?"

I'd even explore partnering with the extensions themselves, positioning getBenson as a neutral analytics platform that helps brands make informed decisions rather than pushing a narrative about good versus bad.

**The partnership paradox.** My original approach created unnecessary enemies. A collaborative approach would have aligned with affiliate networks' interests rather than opposing them. My original adversarial stance put me at odds with networks who benefited from extension commissions - why would they support something that reduced their revenue?

**The maturity of perspective.** Experience has taught me that adversarial strategies have limited reach. True success comes from creating value for all stakeholders, providing transparent data that empowers informed decisions rather than forcing a particular narrative.

This shift from "blocking the enemy" to "measuring the impact" represents a fundamental evolution in how I approach business problems - from zero-sum competition to value creation for all parties.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will this hurt my conversion rate?">
    No. Data shows conversion rates typically increase 5-15% because extensions
    no longer tell customers to shop elsewhere when they can't find codes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is this legal?">
    Absolutely. Merchants have every right to control how their website
    functions and what third-party scripts can access their checkout.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if extensions adapt?">
    getBenson uses machine learning and continuous updates. The system has
    successfully blocked extensions through 200+ attempted workarounds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can customers tell they're being blocked?">
