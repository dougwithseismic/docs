## The Origin Story

### From VoucherCloud to getBenson

Our journey to getBenson began at VoucherCloud, which later got acquired by Groupon. Working in the voucher publishing space provided a unique vantage point to see both sides of the Honey problem.

"As a Honey user myself, I saw that a lot of the times they were getting affiliate revenue for not giving any value, essentially. The codes weren't working. As a brand, I wouldn't pay for it," we recall.

The problem ran deeper than just broken codes. There was a conspiracy of silence in the affiliate industry:

"Affiliate managers and networks get a kickback from Honey every time they make a sale. So they would never bad mouth them because they were such a cash cow. It was the B2C brands that were really shafted - caught between a rock and a hard place because they weren't getting the information they needed to make a solid judgment on whether Honey was good or bad for them."

Our unique position - understanding both the affiliate space and having the technical capability to build a solution - made the opportunity clear.

## The Challenge

Every e-commerce store faces an invisible profit leak: browser extensions like Honey, Capital One Shopping, and Rakuten that auto-apply discount codes at checkout. While marketed as "helping consumers save money," these extensions create significant problems for online retailers:

### The Hidden Cost of Discount Extensions

- **Margin Erosion**: Extensions apply codes meant for specific customer segments (email subscribers, first-time buyers) to everyone
- **Affiliate Commission Hijacking**: Extensions claim last-click attribution even when they didn't drive the sale
- **Cart Abandonment**: When extensions can't find codes, they tell customers "better deals exist elsewhere"
- **Destroyed Pricing Strategy**: Carefully planned promotions become universal discounts
- **Brand Devaluation**: Training customers to never pay full price

The numbers are staggering:
- 100+ million users have Honey installed
- Average margin loss: 12-15% per transaction
- Affiliate commission theft: $2.4B annually across e-commerce
- Cart abandonment increase: 23% when no codes found

## The Breaking Point

Consider this scenario: A DTC brand spends $50,000 on influencer marketing, offering exclusive 20% off codes to track ROI. But when customers reach checkout:

1. Honey pops up and applies the influencer code automatically
2. Honey claims the affiliate commission (2-8% of sale)
3. The brand loses both the discount margin AND pays commission to Honey
4. The influencer partnership ROI becomes impossible to track
5. Future influencers refuse to promote without higher rates

This pattern repeats across email campaigns, loyalty programs, and strategic partnerships.

## The Solution

### The Decision to Build

"I was looking at what was out there before building to see if this was something that someone had already solved. There were one or two, but nothing that stood out as the be-all solution."

Our vision was clear: Can we detect Chrome extensions? Can we stop them from running? Can we help brands save more margin?

"I needed to do this. I had clients from my affiliate site that were talking about this, and it was a no-brainer for me to be able to spin this up."

getBenson became the first comprehensive defense system against discount extension parasites. Instead of accepting these losses as "cost of doing business," getBenson blocks extensions from interfering with checkout flows entirely.

### The Technical Battle

Building getBenson in 2018 meant entering an evolving cat-and-mouse game between extensions and detection methods.

"Pretty tough because every extension is built differently. Some run as scripts in the main world versus isolated - it's a Chrome extension, web extension development term. There are safety features like shadow DOMs, which meant that essentially extensions couldn't see what was inside."

Our process was iterative and challenging:

"I went through loads of different strategies and tactics to detect these extensions. The more you get into it, the more you realize that you do need the safety stuff - you need some level of safety involved there, which meant that both worlds can't interact with one another unless specifically wanting to."

### The Breakthrough

Our solution came from an unexpected approach:

"The best moment I had was just treating it like reversing an app - using API calls to detect whether certain files were available within the web extension that would be exposed by the browser. That way I had a fingerprint that I could then say: okay, Honey is being used, or Retail Me Not is being used, Rakuten is being used here."

### How It Works

**Detection Layer**
- API-based fingerprinting of exposed extension files
- Real-time identification of 50+ discount extensions
- Browser-level detection that extensions can't hide from

**Protection Layer**
- Shadow DOM implementation for checkout isolation
- Blocks extension access to protected elements
- Maintains separation between extension and checkout worlds
- Preserves normal checkout flow for legitimate customers

**Intelligence Layer**
- Analytics dashboard for impact measurement
- Extension usage tracking by customer segment
- A/B testing capabilities for measuring true impact
- ROI tracking on protection implementation

### Platform Support

## Customer Discovery

### The First Client: Theory11

"Our first client was Theory11 - a premium playing card B2C brand. It was a no-brainer for them to pick up because they had seen the impact of Honey on their bottom line and wanted to get rid of it. They tried other solutions in the space but they weren't working well."

### Two Types of Buyers

Through customer conversations, we discovered two distinct buyer personas:

**The Immediate Blockers**
"I just want to block Honey. I'm losing margin and I want to block it." These brands knew the problem and wanted an immediate solution.

**The Data-Driven Analysts**
"The more savvy ones were actually like, 'I don't really want to block them straight away. I want to know the impact here.' So that led us down the route of building out not just a blocker but an analytics and impact tool to work out what the actual impact was."

This insight shaped getBenson's evolution from pure blocking tool to comprehensive analytics platform.

## The Unexpected End

### Shopify's Checkout Changes

"Eventually, Shopify blocked third-party scripts running on the checkout. So getBenson died an untimely death."

This was before Shopify's sweeping changes to allow checkout extensions - a platform decision that fundamentally changed what was possible in the e-commerce protection space.

## Lessons Learned

### From Adversarial to Analytical

Looking back, we see a different path:

"Building getBenson again today, we'd focus less on being adversarial and saying 'I'm going to block extensions because they're stealing margin.' We'd focus way more on the impact analysis. Let's find out: Is Honey good or bad for you? What money are you making here?"

Our vision evolved from blocking to partnering:

"We would go down that route and partner with the extensions so that they can use getBenson as a sales tool. Really, we're just showing people what the impact is and not trying to force them down a narrative of 'X is bad, Y is bad.'"

### The Partnership Paradox

Our original approach created unnecessary enemies:

"That would get the affiliate networks on board and involved a lot more. When we were trying to sell it to them previously, it was at direct odds with them because they wanted the kickback from the affiliate sale. So why would they want to block this?"

### The Maturity of Perspective

"As we mature and get older, we realize being adversarial only gets you so far. Being a real partner and giving value to everyone - letting them make up their own minds and decisions and narrative - is the way forward."

This shift from "blocking the enemy" to "measuring the impact" represents a fundamental evolution in approaching business problems - from zero-sum competition to value creation for all parties.
