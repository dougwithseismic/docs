## Did You Know You're Being Scored Right Now?

Yes, you. As you read this sentence, I'm tracking your engagement. Not in a creepy way - in a smart, efficient way that respects both our time.

<VisitorProfile />

## Why I Built This

Here's the thing: I've spent years in MarTech and engineering, building tools that qualify leads for enterprise companies. But when it came to my own consultancy, I was flying blind. I'd get inquiries, hop on calls, and often realize 10 minutes in that we weren't a fit.

That's a waste of everyone's time.

So I built what I know - a lead qualification system that runs silently in the background, scoring visitors based on genuine engagement signals. If you're reading this, exploring my tools, and spending real time understanding what I offer, I want to know about it. If you're just bouncing through, that's cool too - but neither of us needs to pretend it's more than that.

## How The Scoring Works

### The Point System

Every action you take has a value:

- **Page View**: 5 points (you showed up)
- **Scroll to 25%**: 2 points (you started reading)
- **Scroll to 50%**: 3 points (you're interested)
- **Scroll to 75%**: 5 points (you're engaged)
- **Scroll to 100%**: 7 points (you're thorough)
- **30 seconds on page**: 3 points (not a bounce)
- **60 seconds on page**: 5 points (actually reading)
- **2+ minutes on page**: 10 points (deep engagement)
- **Copy code block**: 10 points (hands-on interest)
- **Use a tool**: 15 points (practical engagement)
- **Perform calculation**: 20 points (solving real problems)
- **Visit contact page**: 50 points (high intent)

### Engagement Levels

- **Cold** (0-999 points): Just browsing
- **Warm** (1000-2499 points): Showing interest
- **Hot** (2500-4999 points): Actively engaged
- **Qualified** (5000+ points): Ready for a conversation

### Real-Time Toast Notifications

As you browse and your engagement level changes, you'll see subtle toast notifications appear in the corner of your screen. These aren't just notifications - they're real-time feedback on your engagement journey:

- **‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold Toast**: "Getting started - Keep exploring to warm things up!"
- **üî• Warm Toast**: "You're warming up! Your engagement is growing."
- **üî• Hot Toast**: "Things are heating up! You're highly engaged."
- **üéØ Qualified Toast**: "You're a qualified lead! We should definitely talk."

These toasts slide in from the left, stay for 6 seconds, then gracefully exit. They're color-coded to match your engagement level and only appear once per level to avoid being annoying.

## The Smart Signals

Beyond points, I track behavioral patterns that indicate real interest:

### Content Patterns

- **Multi-page visitor**: You're exploring beyond the landing page
- **Deep explorer**: 5+ unique pages viewed
- **Deep content consumer**: Reading to the bottom of multiple articles
- **Case study reader**: Looking at real examples
- **Tool user**: Actually trying the solutions

### Time Investment

- **Engaged reader**: Averaging 60+ seconds per page
- **High time investment**: 5+ minutes total on site

### Intent Signals

- **Contact visitor**: Checked out how to reach me
- **Booking intent**: Clicked on consultation links
- **Company info provided**: Shared who you are
- **Email provided**: Opened a direct line

## Why This Matters

### For You

- No time wasted on calls that won't go anywhere
- I already understand your level of interest
- Our first conversation can skip the basics
- You're not just another "lead" in a CRM

### For Me

- I can prioritize high-intent prospects
- I understand what content resonates
- I know which problems you're trying to solve
- I can prepare for our conversation properly

## The Technical Implementation

This system is built with:

- **Pure JavaScript**: No heavy analytics platforms
- **LocalStorage**: Your data stays in your browser
- **Real-time tracking**: Updates as you browse
- **Session awareness**: Handles tab switches and returns
- **Page-centric data**: Detailed engagement per page

Every page visit creates a session record with:

- Time spent
- Scroll depth
- Links clicked
- Actions taken
- Content categories viewed

## What Happens When You're Qualified

When you hit 5000 points (qualified lead), I get a notification with:

- Your engagement score and signals
- Top pages you've spent time on
- Tools you've used
- Content categories that interest you
- Your overall journey through the site

This isn't about surveillance - it's about preparation. When we do connect, I'll already understand:

- What you're looking for
- Which solutions resonate
- Where you're spending time
- What problems you're solving

## The Philosophy

This is the same approach I help companies implement:

1. **Respect the visitor's time**: Don't make them fill out forms for basic content
2. **Measure real engagement**: Not just pageviews, but meaningful interaction
3. **Qualify through behavior**: Actions speak louder than form fields
4. **Focus on fit**: Not every visitor needs to be a lead
5. **Prepare for success**: When someone is ready, be ready for them

## Try It Yourself

Want to see your scoring in action? Here's what to do:

1. Open your browser console (F12)
2. Type: `WithSeismicTracker.enableDebug()`
3. Browse around and watch your score update
4. Type: `WithSeismicTracker.getProfile()` to see your full profile

### Testing the Toast Notifications

Want to see all the toast notifications in action? Open your console and run:

```javascript
// Test all engagement level toasts in sequence
WithSeismicTracker.testToasts();

// Or trigger individual toasts
WithSeismicTracker.showToast("Custom message!", "warm", 5000);
WithSeismicTracker.showToast("You're on fire!", "hot", 5000);
WithSeismicTracker.showToast("Welcome aboard!", "qualified", 5000);
```

The toasts will appear in the bottom-left corner with smooth animations. They stack if multiple are shown, and each has its own color theme matching the engagement level.

Or just keep reading, exploring, and using the tools. If what I'm building resonates with you, your score will reflect that - and you'll see the toasts appear naturally as you progress through the engagement levels. When you're ready to talk, I'll be ready too.

### Gamification & Achievement System

Beyond just scoring, I've added a full achievement system that makes browsing more engaging. You're not just accumulating points - you're unlocking badges for different behaviors. Check your achievements displayed at the top of your profile card above!

#### Available Achievements

```javascript
// See all available achievements and your progress
WithSeismicTracker.showAllAchievements();

// Test an achievement notification
WithSeismicTracker.testAchievement("deep_diver");

// Check what you've unlocked so far
WithSeismicTracker.getUnlockedAchievements();
```

Here are some achievements you can unlock:

- **üë£ First Steps**: Visit your first page (you already have this!)
- **üó∫Ô∏è Explorer**: Visit 5 different pages
- **ü§ø Deep Diver**: Scroll to 100% on 3 pages
- **‚ö° Speed Reader**: Visit 10 pages in under 5 minutes
- **üìö Dedicated Reader**: Spend over 10 minutes reading
- **üìä Case Study Enthusiast**: Read 3 case studies
- **üîß Tool Tester**: Try at least one tool
- **ü¶â Night Owl**: Browse after midnight
- **üê¶ Early Bird**: Browse before 7 AM
- **üîÑ Return Visitor**: Come back for a second visit
- **üíº Serious Buyer**: Visit pricing and contact pages
- **üìã Code Copier**: Copy a code block
- **üïµÔ∏è Tracker Detective**: Discover this lead qualifier case study (you have this!)
- **üìà Insider Trading**: Read 100% of how I'm tracking you (scroll to the bottom of this page!)
- **üèÜ Engagement Champion**: Reach 'Hot' engagement level
- **üëë Qualified Legend**: Become a qualified lead (5000 points)

Each achievement unlocks with a purple toast notification. Your unlocked achievements are saved and displayed with timestamps. It's a small touch that makes the experience more memorable.

#### Why Gamification?

This isn't just for fun (though it is fun). Gamification serves real business purposes:

1. **Increased Engagement**: Achievements give visitors reasons to explore more content
2. **Behavioral Insights**: Achievement patterns reveal visitor interests and intent
3. **Memorable Experience**: People remember sites that surprise and delight them
4. **Qualification Signals**: Achievement combinations indicate buying readiness
5. **Return Incentive**: Unfinished achievements encourage return visits

For example, someone who unlocks "Tool Tester," "Case Study Enthusiast," and "Serious Buyer" is showing clear product evaluation behavior. That's more valuable than any form field.

#### Implementation Notes

The achievement system is lightweight and runs entirely client-side:

- Achievements check conditions in real-time as you browse
- Unlocked achievements persist in localStorage
- Toast notifications appear with a 1.5-second stagger for multiple unlocks
- Each achievement has an icon, name, and description for clarity
- The profile component displays your achievement collection

This same gamification approach can be applied to any business:

- **SaaS**: Unlock features through exploration
- **E-commerce**: Reward browsing patterns with discounts
- **Content Sites**: Badge readers for completion milestones
- **B2B**: Identify champions through engagement achievements

## The Bottom Line

This lead qualifier is exactly what I build for clients - intelligent, behavioral tracking that identifies real interest without being intrusive. It's the difference between "spray and pray" marketing and actually understanding who's interested in what you offer.

If you've made it this far, you're already at "warm" or higher. That tells me this approach resonates with you. Maybe you're thinking about your own lead qualification challenges. Maybe you're wondering how this could work for your business.

Either way, your behavior is telling a story. And I'm listening.
