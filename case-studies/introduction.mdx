## What These Projects Have in Common

Most involve taking something manual and making it automatic. Contra needed job listings - we built a Chrome extension that let 20,000 users find them. Fingers on Pulse was watching YouTube manually - we automated 800+ channels. getBenson was losing margin to discount extensions - we blocked them.

The pattern: find the repetitive work, automate it, measure what changes.
