## What Unique Skills Does WithSeismic Bring?

<Info>
  **Quick Answer**: We uniquely combine product engineering, technical MarTech
  expertise, and analytics & data capabilities—creating automation that drives
  measurable business outcomes.
</Info>

Most automation builders come from one discipline. We come from the intersection of three:

**Solutions Architecture**: We design and build complete systems that solve impossible problems. Chrome extensions that become networks. Automation that thinks and adapts. Check the [case studies](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation).

**Creative Automation**: Over a decade building systems that shouldn't exist. We don't just automate existing processes—we reimagine them entirely. Created autonomous systems that make decisions, self-optimize, and scale infinitely. Built impossible integrations between systems that weren't meant to talk. The kind of automation that makes people ask "wait, how is that even possible?"

**Skunkworks Engineering**: We excel at rapid prototyping of moonshot ideas. Built systems that process at inhuman speeds, make intelligent decisions, and operate with zero human intervention. Created solutions that competitors deemed impossible—from distributed intelligence networks to self-managing marketplaces. We don't ask "can it be done?" We ask "how fast can we build it?"

That intersection creates solutions that redefine what's possible.

</Info>

<Warning>
  **The window for building the impossible is now**: While others are stuck in
  "that can't be done," you can deploy game-changing automation in weeks.
  The advantage of being first to the impossible is permanent.
</Warning>

Accepting limitations leads to limited outcomes. Breaking through requires creative automation. The formula is straightforward:

1. **Build impossible systems** that do what humans can't—think faster, scale infinitely, never sleep
2. **Automate the unautomatable** through creative engineering and skunkworks thinking
3. **Create technical moats** that competitors can't copy because they can't imagine them

The companies building impossible automation today are tomorrow's market leaders. They're not just optimizing processes—they're creating entirely new ways to operate. See what's possible in our [case studies](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation).

_WithSeismic is an automation consultancy that builds impossible solutions. We create systems that shouldn't exist—from Chrome extensions that become living networks to LLM workflows that think at inhuman speeds to autonomous marketplaces that run themselves. Founded by a solutions architect who's spent 15+ years building what others said couldn't be done._

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly is your "skunkworks approach"?

Our skunkworks approach means rapidly prototyping impossible solutions—the kind of automation that makes people say "I didn't know that was possible." Instead of iterating on existing processes, we reimagine them entirely. Like Chrome extensions that turn users into distributed networks or LLM workflows that process content at inhuman speeds.

### How is WithSeismic different from traditional dev agencies?

Traditional agencies build what you ask for. We build what you didn't know was possible. We combine deep engineering with creative problem-solving and a skunkworks mentality. We don't just code—we solve impossible problems.

### What size companies do you work with?

We primarily work with ambitious teams at SaaS companies, marketplaces, and digital-first brands doing $1M-$50M ARR. Teams that face impossible challenges and need creative automation to transform how they compete.

### How long does a typical engagement take?

Our Skunkworks Sprint takes 2 weeks and builds one impossible solution. Our Automation System takes 4 weeks and creates interconnected automation. Most clients see transformational impact within the first month.

### Do you require long-term contracts?

No. We work in focused sprints with clear deliverables. Our 2-week and 4-week engagements are project-based. Many clients return for additional projects, but there's no lock-in.

### What technologies do you specialize in?

Chrome extension development (React, TypeScript, MV3), LLM workflows (OpenAI, Claude, custom chains), browser automation (Playwright, Puppeteer), MCP servers, and modern web stack (Next.js, Node, Python).

### Can you work with our existing tech stack?

Yes. We've integrated with hundreds of different systems and APIs. Our solutions are designed to enhance your existing infrastructure, not replace it. We build bridges, not islands.

### How do you measure success?

We measure success by business impact: revenue increase, cost reduction, time saved, conversion improvement. Every project includes clear KPIs and measurement frameworks. Check our case studies for specific metrics.

### Do you provide ongoing support after delivery?

We deliver production-ready systems with documentation and handoff. We offer maintenance packages if needed, but our systems are built to be self-sustaining. We also train your team to manage and extend what we build.

### What if we don't know exactly what we need?

That's our specialty. We start with your business problems, not technical specifications. Our discovery process identifies the highest-impact opportunities, then we build solutions that deliver measurable results.

### What acquisition channels are you actively in on a daily basis?

We're active across both paid and organic channels. On the paid side, we run programmatic advertising through automated feeds across Meta, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Google Search. For organic, we create technical content on YouTube, build open-source tools on GitHub, and share automation breakthroughs on LinkedIn. Everything is automated where possible—we use the same impossible automation we build for clients to run our own operations.
