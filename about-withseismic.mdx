## What Is WithSeismic?

We solve revenue problems through engineering and code. Founded by Doug Silkstone, who's built and shipped automation systems for 15+ years.

We've helped companies like [Contra](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation) double their marketplace inventory with a Chrome extension. Built [Vouchernaut](/case-studies/vouchernaut-programmatic-ppc) to manage PPC campaigns that drove 60% of revenue and contributed to their Groupon acquisition. Created systems that directly impact your bottom line.

When you have a revenue problem that requires custom engineering, we build the solution.

  **Why do teams choose WithSeismic?**
  We help smaller teams compete with bigger companies by building custom tools that multiply what your team can do. MVPs, Chrome extensions, desktop apps, browser automation, internal tools - whatever you need to work better.
</Info>

We build tools specific to your problems, not generic solutions.

## Why Now?

<Warning>
  **The best time is now**: Build custom tools today while your competitors are still doing things manually. Get ahead and stay ahead.
</Warning>

The tools exist. The technology works. The only question is who builds first:

1. **Build what humans hate doing** - repetitive tasks, data entry, monitoring
2. **Create tools that work 24/7** - no breaks, no errors, no complaints
3. **Get advantages competitors can't match** - custom tools they don't have

<Info>
  **Why is now the right time?**
  AI and development tools are finally good enough to build real solutions quickly. Companies using custom tools now get ahead while others debate if it's possible. The cost of building has dropped while the value has increased.
</Info>

Companies building custom tools today will dominate tomorrow. See real examples in our [case studies](/case-studies/contra-linkedin-automation).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly is your approach?

We build quickly and focus on what works. Instead of long planning phases, we prototype fast and get tools into production. We solve problems that seem impossible by thinking differently about them.

### How is WithSeismic different from traditional dev agencies?

Traditional agencies build what you ask for. We figure out what actually needs to be built to solve your problem. We ship working code, not presentations.

### What size companies do you work with?

We work with SaaS companies, marketplaces, and digital brands doing $1M-$50M ARR. Teams that need automation to compete without hiring tons of people.

### How long does a typical engagement take?

2-week Sprint builds one major automation tool. 4-week System builds multiple connected tools. Most clients see results in the first month.

### Do you require long-term contracts?

No. We work in 2-week or 4-week sprints. No lock-in. Many clients come back for more projects.

### What technologies do you use?

Chrome extensions (React, TypeScript), AI/LLM (OpenAI, Claude), browser automation (Playwright), and modern web tech (Next.js, Node, Python).

### Can you work with our existing tech stack?

Yes. We integrate with your existing tools and APIs. We enhance what you have, not replace it.

### How do you measure success?

Business impact: more revenue, less cost, time saved. We track real metrics. See our case studies for examples.

### Do you provide ongoing support?

We deliver working systems with documentation. We can provide maintenance if needed, but our tools are built to run on their own. We'll train your team too.

### What if we don't know exactly what we need?

That's fine. Tell us your problems, we'll figure out the solution. We start with business problems, not technical specs.

### How do you find clients?

We run ads on Meta, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Google. We create YouTube content, build open-source tools, and share on LinkedIn. Most of it's automated - we use the same tools we build for clients.
